      "content": "Monday, March 31, 2008 The day began pleasantly enough in Oklahoma City. It was sunny, but as was often the case this time of year, windy and cool – much the same as it was on the day 27 years (and one day) ago, when the attempt was made on President Reagan’s life. There was a reason Johnny Woodward’s group did not meet on Tuesdays. They met every Monday morning for breakfast at Faye’s Café. The group, which now called themselves the ROB (Retired Old Boys) Club, dined in a private room. Johnny was especially grateful for the privacy this morning, as he did not wish for anyone to overhear what he was planning to discuss. During breakfast, he did not say or do anything that would cause the others alarm, although a couple of friends noticed that he was unusually tense. Johnny looked around the table at his four best friends. There were -- at one point in time -- six of them, including himself. But Eddie had died the same afternoon of the unsuccessful attempt on President Reagan’s life. Eddie had died on a Tuesday. And Johnny knew Eddie had been murdered. He knew also that the killer was at the table with them. Johnny didn’t completely understand his motive for doing what he was about to do. He was weary of carrying such a dark and burdensome secret all these years, but mainly he had come to realize that none of them were growing any younger, and that justice had to be carried out soon. He would not be able to live with himself any longer if the murderer continued to go on without suffering the consequences for what he had done. He also felt it would be right to allow Eddie’s family some measure of closure. He had covered for the killer long enough. After the dishes were cleared away and the coffee cups were refilled, the ROB’s favorite waitress, Mona, excused herself and, at Johnny’s request, shut the door to the private dining room. “Why did you have her do that?” asked Tim, who had worked for Johnny, as they all had, before retiring from the network department of the local school system. Johnny took a deep breath and replied, “Because we have something important to discuss.” Al, alarmed, asked, “And what would that be?” Swallowing the lump in his throat, Johnny continued, “You know yesterday was Eddie’s 27th anniversary. I have to tell you, he didn’t just die. One of us murdered him. Had it not been for the intense focus on the Reagan shooting that afternoon, I’m certain he would have been found out.” The table became eerily quiet. Al again spoke, asking, “How do you know this?” Johnny took a deep breath, “Does everyone remember where we were on that day? It was a Tuesday. It was a hectic day for me as my grandfather passed away that morning. Plus we had that big computer upgrade going on. President Reagan getting shot only added more stress to an already too long day.” “Yeah, I remember,” said Al, “we were all in the computer room. I remember we were all freezing in that cold room.” “That’s right, agreed Johnny, “and it was assumed Eddie died of a heart attack.” “Right after we heard Reagan had been shot.” Ray added. “I remember the computer room had a television set with cable, which was a novelty at the time and something Johnny got for us as a favor. When news of the shooting came on, everyone’s attention turned to the news. It was 1:40 p.m. and the upgrade was nearing completion.” Everyone focused intently on Johnny as he began to speak. “As you recall, that morning we gathered early for our upgrade. I arrived first to unlock the computer room and cabinets.” Johnny smiled, and then continued, “I would have had one of you do that, but back then only managers carried keys. Recall also that our whole team was involved in it, as it was 1981 and one of the first major IT upgrades. By 1:45 p.m. or so, all was going well and we had the television on. Reagan had been shot at about 1:30 p.m. central time, and news of this was on all of the major channels. It provided enough distraction to give the killer an excellent opportunity to lace Eddie’s cup of coffee with poison. As I recall, Eddie drank the fateful swallow as we watched video clips of the shooting.” Incredulous, Watson asked, “How do you know he was poisoned?” “The killer left the half empty bottle of poison in a cabinet drawer -- it was a huge bottle, not easily concealed, and I didn’t retrieve it until a couple of months later.” Al angrily asked, “So who did it?” Johnny took turns looking at them all. He said, “I don’t want to finger the killer until we talk this out.” Tim replied, sadly, “OK. Let’s go back to square one. When the television flashed the news about the shooting, we gathered around the file table. The coffee was brewed by me and poured before the cups were taken to the table. Al was already at the table before the coffee was poured.” Al, thinking out loud, asked, “Who had the poison and when was it slipped into Eddie’s coffee?” Johnny said, “Let’s continue. Watson and I wore lab coats in the computer room to say warm. We could have easily hid a bottle in our jackets.” Tim said, “I had on a long sleeve shirt that day, with blue jeans but no jacket. I was freezing.” Ray said, “I had on a short sleeve shirt and slacks. I’m always warm, so the cold felt good.” Watson said, slowly, “I poured the coffee into the cups. I noticed what I believed to be an inch of standing water in one of them by the tray’s edge. I remember this because it was a bit fuller than the others after I poured and I was concerned that the server would splash it on his shirt. I didn’t think anything more of it, other than I thought it would help to cool the hot coffee. Besides, I didn’t serve the coffee. Johnny did.” Johnny asked, “So the poison was in the cup when you poured it?” “Yes.” Al, who had been silent for a while, said, “I remember Johnny brought the coffee over. If I recall, you asked everyone to take a cup from the tray.” “That’s correct.” “Wasn’t Eddie the last one served?” “Yes.”",

Will someone please explain.”\n“Well, we know it wasn’t me” Al said. “I was already sitting when the coffee was brought over. So, I would have taken a big chance on selecting what we knew was a poisoned cup from the tray. We also know it wasn’t Ray or Tim. They couldn’t have snuck a bottle of poison into the lab at an earlier time without Johnny unlocking it for them, and neither wore clothing baggy or loose enough to conceal a container on upgrade day.”\nAl paused for moment, fighting emotion, he knew he was going to soon accuse an old and dear friend of murder. Looking at Johnny, he said, “That leaves you and Watson.” Pausing again, he said to Watson, “You poured the coffee and knew which cup had liquid in the bottom. That’s pretty damning, old friend.”\n“Yes, replied Watson, calmly, “but I didn’t serve the drinks.”\n“No you didn’t.” The room fell silent, waiting for Al to finish. “Johnny, it was you. You were you the only person who could have retrieved the poison a couple of months later, in a locked cabinet in a locked room … where you were the only one who possessed a key to both. I believe you owe all of us an explanation.”\nJohnny’s look of guilt turned to one of relief. Quietly, he said to them, “Recall that my grandfather had been ill. In fact he died the morning of the Reagan shooting. I had helped my parents for some time to pay his medical bills and money was tight. I had also loaned Eddie some money a few months earlier and he told me he was unable to pay me back. That’s not much of an explanation, but there it is. The pressure got to me and it frightens me to this day that one can so easily be led to murder. I like to think that I would have backed out of hurting Eddie, but the importance of the upgrade and the attempt on the president’s life threw me over an emotional edge. John Hinckley was not the only disturbed person to attempt murder that day. I wish now that I had failed as he did.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  The story itself never supplies any strong motive for Tim, Al, Ray or Watson to murder Eddie.  \n   •  Johnny, however, tells us straight-out that he was in desperate financial straits, had lent Eddie money which Eddie was refusing (or unable) to repay, and that the stress of the day (grand-father’s death, major computer upgrade, the Reagan shooting) pushed him “over an emotional edge.”  Johnny therefore has an explicit motive; nobody else does.\n\n2.  Opportunity  \n   •  Putting poison into the cup had to be done BEFORE Watson filled the cups with coffee, because Watson saw “about an inch of standing water” already in one cup.  \n   •  Whoever put the poison in the cup had to be able to (a) posses the poison somewhere in or near the computer room, and (b) manipulate which cup Eddie finally received.  \n\n   •  Only Johnny and Watson were wearing the long, loose lab coats that could hide a bottle of poison.  \n   •  Only Johnny carried the keys to both the computer-room door and the locked supply cabinet, so only Johnny could have hidden a large bottle there “a couple of months earlier” (exactly what Johnny says he later removed).\n\n3.  Physical evidence  \n   •  A “half-empty bottle of poison” was left in a locked cabinet in a locked room.  The only key-holder was Johnny.  Whoever left that bottle had to expect it would remain undisturbed – in the one place to which only Johnny had free access.  \n   •  Therefore the very existence of that bottle in that location points directly to Johnny.\n\n4.  Control of the poisoned cup  \n   •  Watson poured, but Johnny carried the tray to the table and personally told each man to “take a cup.”  \n   •  Eddie was the last to be served.  Only the man holding the tray could guarantee that the still-untaken cup – the one with the poison already in it – would end up in front of Eddie.  That man was Johnny.\n\n5.  Elimination of the others  \n   •  Al was already seated and would have had a one-in-five chance of picking the fatal cup himself.  A murderer would never rely on such luck.  \n   •  Ray and Tim had no place to conceal a large bottle on upgrade day (short sleeves / no jacket) and, without a key, they could not have stashed the bottle in the cabinet earlier.  \n   •  Watson had a coat and could have slipped poison in the cup, but had no control over which cup Eddie would take.  Only Johnny had both concealment and final control.\n\n6.  Logical conclusion  \n   All clues converge on Johnny: motive, exclusive access to the hiding place, physical possession of the tray at the critical moment, and finally his own confession.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohnny Woodward, Tim (surname unknown), Al (surname unknown), Ray (surname unknown), Watson (surname unknown)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJohnny Woodward\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Some weeks before 31 March 1981 Johnny Woodward brought a large bottle of poison to work and locked it in a cabinet inside the computer room, a room to which only he, as manager, had the keys.\n\n• On Tuesday 31 March 1981 the team gathered early for a major computer upgrade.  Johnny and Watson wore lab coats; the others did not.\n\n• Late in the morning Tim brewed a fresh pot of coffee.  While no one was watching, Johnny retrieved his bottle from the cabinet, poured a small amount of the clear, deadly liquid into one of the empty coffee cups on the tray, and returned the bottle to the cabinet.\n\n• Watson soon came over and filled every cup with coffee.  Noticing an inch of clear liquid already in one cup, he thought it was water and ignored it.\n\n• Johnny picked up the tray and carried it to the file table where the men had gathered to watch the first televised reports of President Reagan’s shooting (1:40 p.m.).\n\n• At Johnny’s invitation each man took a cup.  Johnny made certain Eddie was the last man served, leaving him the cup that held the hidden poison.\n\n• As they watched the broadcast Eddie raised the cup, swallowed, collapsed and died.  With everyone’s attention diverted by the dramatic national news, Eddie’s death was accepted as a sudden heart attack.\n\n• A few months later Johnny quietly removed the still-half-full poison bottle from the cabinet and disposed of it — the one piece of evidence that could truly incriminate him — but the memory of it remained and eventually led him to confess to his friends 27 years later.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Al – Already seated when the tray arrived; had no guarantee of avoiding the poisoned cup.  No access to the locked cabinet and no means to conceal a large bottle in his short-sleeve shirt.  \n• Tim – Brewed the coffee but never touched the cups after that.  Like Al, wore only a long-sleeve shirt and jeans; incapable of hiding or earlier stashing the poison.  \n• Ray – Same clothing problem as Tim, and likewise lacked a key to the locked computer room or cabinet.  \n• Watson – Had the opportunity to slip something into a cup while pouring, but could not control which cup Eddie would ultimately take; only Johnny, as the tray carrier, had that control.  Moreover, Watson lacked any motive and had no access to the locked cabinet where the poison was later found.  \nAll practical means, motive, and the physical evidence point solely to Johnny Woodward, clearing the remaining members of the ROB Club.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

          "reveal_segment": "The murderer smiled a thin smile. Everyone could see the look of guilt upon his face. He said, “Is everyone in agreement?”\nWatson said, “I don’t know. Will someone please explain.”\n“Well, we know it wasn’t me” Al said. “I was already sitting when the coffee was brought over. So, I would have taken a big chance on selecting what we knew was a poisoned cup from the tray. We also know it wasn’t Ray or Tim. They couldn’t have snuck a bottle of poison into the lab at an earlier time without Johnny unlocking it for them, and neither wore clothing baggy or loose enough to conceal a container on upgrade day.”\nAl paused for moment, fighting emotion, he knew he was going to soon accuse an old and dear friend of murder. Looking at Johnny, he said, “That leaves you and Watson.” Pausing again, he said to Watson, “You poured the coffee and knew which cup had liquid in the bottom. That’s pretty damning, old friend.”\n“Yes, replied Watson, calmly, “but I didn’t serve the drinks.”\n“No you didn’t.” The room fell silent, waiting for Al to finish. “Johnny, it was you. You were you the only person who could have retrieved the poison a couple of months later, in a locked cabinet in a locked room … where you were the only one who possessed a key to both. I believe you owe all of us an explanation.”\nJohnny’s look of guilt turned to one of relief. Quietly, he said to them, “Recall that my grandfather had been ill. In fact he died the morning of the Reagan shooting. I had helped my parents for some time to pay his medical bills and money was tight. I had also loaned Eddie some money a few months earlier and he told me he was unable to pay me back. That’s not much of an explanation, but there it is. The pressure got to me and it frightens me to this day that one can so easily be led to murder. I like to think that I would have backed out of hurting Eddie, but the importance of the upgrade and the attempt on the president’s life threw me over an emotional edge. John Hinckley was not the only disturbed person to attempt murder that day. I wish now that I had failed as he did.”"
