      "content": "\"I ain't no leprechaun!\" snarled Randy. \"I'm not even Irish!\" He was three feet tall, he was dressed in a green suit, and he was beginning to hate St. Patrick's Day. A crowd of children swarmed around him excitedly. \"I caught you!\" one little girl screamed. \"Now give me a pot of gold!\" \"If I had a pot of gold, I wouldn't NEED this job,\" Randy moaned. He'd been so excited when his phone rang that morning and his friend Casey offered him an acting job. But now he knew the bad news: that the audience was two hundred seven-year-olds in a grade school auditorium! \"Let me go!\" Randy pleaded. Suddenly a giant pair of hands lifted Randy from the floor. \"Don't embarrass me,\" Casey teased. \"The Mighty Casey\" was a professional wrestler on television for half of every year. But he spent the other six months appearing at schools and conventions \ntrying to earn some extra money. \"We both need the cash,\" he reminded Randy, lifting him onto his shoulder. \"So wave to the nice crowd.\" Randy laughed with Casey and, safe on his shoulder, waved down at the excited children. \"Maybe I should hand out boxes of Lucky Charms,\" Randy joked. \"This wasn't my idea,\" Casey promised him as they hurried toward the exit. \"My career is being managed by a guy named Tony. He thought I'd look even bigger standing next to you!\" \"Just get me out of here!\" Randy said through a clenched smile, still waving to the crowd. Casey waved too, one last time, as he backed through the door and rushed into the empty school hallway. He carried Randy under a banner for the grade school's football team, the Fighting Leprechauns. \"It figures,\" muttered Randy. \"I'm sorry,\" Casey apologized. \"But this could get my picture in the paper. It'd be quite a shot—you and me both dressed up and celebrating St. Patrick's Day!\" Tony had dropped them both off in front of the school's lobby this morning in his expensive sports car and promised to pick them up when they were finished. \"Can we go home now?\" Randy whined. \"We can't,\" Casey said, lifting him down to the floor. \"I promised the teachers that we'd visit their party in the teacher's lounge.\" Randy groaned and said he hoped they wouldn't think he was a leprechaun too. The children were never allowed behind the mysterious door at the end of the hall, but the school's principal, Mr. Carswell, welcomed the two men inside. The teachers had hung green streamers on the walls to help celebrate St. Patrick's Day, and a table at the end of the room was filled with snacks and punch. \"Sorry the children grabbed you,\" Mr. Carswell said sincerely to Randy. \"But our school is famous for our Fighting Leprechaun football team. They won the state grade school championship back in 1983. Their quarterback that season grew up to be a star—he played all through high school, was wooed by a Big Ten college and went on to become a professional football player. He even played in the Super Bowl.\" \"Did they call him the Fighting Leprechaun?\" Randy asked. Mr. Carswell ignored Randy and continued talking about the school's famous football team. \"I've never heard of him,\" said Casey warmly, \"but they sound like they were quite a team.\" \"Did you see the trophy from that 1983 game? It's at the top of our display case in the lobby. It's over two feet tall, and it's actually worth a lot of money. People like to collect things that remind them of that Super Bowl quarterback. To a collector, it would probably be worth fifty thousand dollars!\" \"Unfortunately, it's gone!\" shouted Mrs. Huntington. The elderly teacher had rushed in the door to the lounge, a worried look on her face. \"I was just coming from the auditorium, finishing my turn at supervising the students’ party when I noticed. Someone smashed the glass on the display case, and they've stolen the trophy!\" Everyone scrambled to the lobby only to see the school's janitor sweeping up broken glass. All the trophies were still standing on the bottom four shelves inside the tall floor-to-ceiling case. But over the top shelf, a large hole had been broken through the glass, and where the famous trophy had been, there was just an empty shelf. \"I bet I know the little devil who's behind this,\" Mr. Carswell said. \"Oh, sure. Blame the little person!\" Randy said angrily. \"Not you,\" said Mr. Carswell. \"I meant a student named Barry. He's a second-grader and the star football player on the team these days. But everyone tells him he's not as good as the 1983 quarterback, and I think he resents it. Barry's always getting into trouble.\" Casey was concerned. \"Who was the last person in this lobby?\" he asked. \"I was,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. \"All the children were already in the auditorium to see 'The Mighty Casey'. I saw the trophy in its case as I closed the auditorium's doors, just as you two came onto the stage.\" \"But what about Barry?\" Casey asked. \"Where was he this whole time?\" \"I was on duty in the auditorium just now, during the party. We teachers watch our students carefully, but an event like this it’s easy to be overwhelmed,” Mrs. Huntington said. \"It's possible that Barry slipped away. But I know I saw him in the auditorium at some point this morning.\" \"Does anyone have a key to the display case?\" Casey asked. \"I have the only key,\" admitted Mr. Carswell. Everyone was concerned about the lost trophy. \"This is the worst St. Patrick's Day party ever,\" Randy complained. But just then, he saw Tony striding down the hall. Casey's manager had finally arrived to pick them up. \"How did it go?\" Tony asked. Casey glared at him and said, \"An elementary school? You couldn't find us some place more glamorous to appear? \"You know the truth is ugly,\" Tony joked. \"I can always use more money, and if you make more appearances, I'll earn more!\" The police arrived. The whole town was anxious about the theft of their famous trophy, and local news reporters were already gathering outside, broadcasting stories about the investigation. In the next hour, the police were busy. They searched every classroom, every desk, the backstage of the auditorium, the teacher’s lounge and even Mr. Carswell's office, but they found no trace of the famous trophy. Everyone stared, discouraged, at the empty display case until suddenly Randy said something that startled them all. \"You can stop searching,\" Randy announced. \"Because I know where the trophy is.\"",

But the police were already running into the parking lot, followed by the cameras of the news reporters. Casey pointed out Tony's car, and the police demanded Tony's keys. There was nothing inside, but then the police opened Tony's trunk.\nAnd there stood the famous trophy.\n\"I told you I can always use more money,\" said Tony sadly.\n\"It serves you right,\" Randy told Tony, \"for getting us such a lousy gig. But look on the bright side. I bet they'll put our picture in the newspaper now!\"\n\"There's some bad news too,\" Casey warned Randy, looking at his green suit. \"They're probably going to call you the Fighting Leprechaun!\"\n\"Oh no!\" Randy wailed, as everybody laughed.",

They searched every classroom, every desk, the backstage of the auditorium, the teacher’s lounge and even Mr. Carswell's office, but they found no trace of the famous trophy. Everyone stared, discouraged, at the empty display case until suddenly Randy said something that startled them all. \"You can stop searching,\" Randy announced. \"Because I know where the trophy is.\"\n\"Did Barry steal it?\" Mrs. Huntington wondered.\n\"That hole in the glass was on the fifth shelf!\" Randy laughed. \"A second grader like Barry couldn't reach up that high.\"\n\"And neither could you,\" Casey teased.\n\"That's how I know!\" Randy admitted. \"It had to be a grown-up.\"\n\"Maybe Mr. Carswell stole the trophy,\" Tony suggested.\n\"But he has a key!\" Randy said. \"Mr. Carswell would've just unlocked the case, instead of breaking in. If he had replaced the trophy with a duplicate, no one would even know that he'd stolen the original!\"\n\"Maybe Casey stole the trophy,\" Mrs. Huntington said, still suspicious.\n\"But we all saw Casey speaking in the auditorium,\" Mr. Carswell pointed, \"and he was there when the trophy was stolen.\"\n\"There's one clue you all overlooked,\" Randy said with a smile. \"The police searched the entire school. So the trophy couldn't be hidden here. The thief must've been someone who could run off after stealing it.\"\n\"And someone who knew we'd all be in the auditorium for an hour,\" Randy said.\n\"Someone who was by the lobby right before it disappeared, who's hungry for money, and who's a big greedy jerk who made me wear this green suit!\" Randy said, pointing a tiny finger at Tony.\n\"No wonder you wanted me to appear at this school!\" Casey said. \"You wanted me to lure everyone to the auditorium while you snuck into the lobby!\"\n\"You can't prove that it was me!\" Tony said. But the police were already running into the parking lot, followed by the cameras of the news reporters. Casey pointed out Tony's car, and the police demanded Tony's keys. There was nothing inside, but then the police opened Tony's trunk.\nAnd there stood the famous trophy.\n\"I told you I can always use more money,\" said Tony sadly.\n\"It serves you right,\" Randy told Tony, \"for getting us such a lousy gig. But look on the bright side. I bet they'll put our picture in the newspaper now!\"\n\"There's some bad news too,\" Casey warned Randy, looking at his green suit. \"They're probably going to call you the Fighting Leprechaun!\"\n\"Oh no!\" Randy wailed, as everybody laughed.\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nSummary (concise, no private reasoning disclosed):  \nThe guilty party must be an adult (trophy high up, lock smashed instead of opened), someone who was free while everyone else was in the auditorium, who clearly wants money, and who arrived/departed in a car large enough to hide a two-foot trophy. All clues converge on Casey’s manager, Tony. The discovery of the trophy in his car clinches it.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTony (Casey’s manager), Casey (“The Mighty Casey”), Randy (actor in green suit), Mr. Carswell (principal), Mrs. Huntington (teacher), Barry (second-grade football player)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTony\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Early that morning Tony drops Casey and Randy at the school, notes the valuable 1983 trophy on the top shelf, and sees that the lobby will soon be empty while the assembly runs.  \n2. During the show, Tony returns, smashes the top pane of glass (faster than fiddling with the lock he doesn’t possess), seizes the trophy, carries it outside, and locks it in his car trunk.  \n3. He drives off briefly, then comes back at pick-up time assuming no one will notice until later.  \n4. When the theft is discovered, Randy reasons that only an adult outsider with a strong money motive—and free access to a getaway vehicle—fits the facts, so he singles out Tony.  \n5. Police open Tony’s trunk and recover the trophy exactly where Randy predicted.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Casey – On stage the whole time, visible to hundreds of witnesses.  \n• Randy – Too short to reach the top shelf through the hole; also visible with Casey.  \n• Mr. Carswell – Has the only key; if he wanted the trophy he’d unlock the case, not smash it.  \n• Mrs. Huntington – Supervising students in the auditorium; no opportunity to slip away unnoticed.  \n• Barry – A second-grader; physically unable to reach the fifth shelf and lacks a place to hide a two-foot trophy.  \nOnly Tony had motive (money), opportunity (was not in the auditorium), and means (car trunk) to commit and conceal the theft.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
