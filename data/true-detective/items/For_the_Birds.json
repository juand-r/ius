      "content": "Hal Feders loved birds: all kinds of birds. He loved watching them, listening to them, feeding them, and, on occasion, eating them and their byproducts. He kept chickens, geese and peacocks on his rural property, and he’d just recently excavated and then watered a large duck pond in back of his house. He hoped to attract a wide range of wild waterfowl with his pond and even had in mind stocking it with a couple of swans. So, he was more than a little excited when he woke up one morning to find a pair of green-headed mallards floating in his brand-new paddling sanctuary. He rushed down to the edge of the pond to welcome his first billed guests. But they quickly duck-paddled away from him, over to the other side of the pond. “Skittish, huh?” Hal said. “Well, I’ll soon fix that.” He ran back to his small barn to get the fifty-pound sack of birdseed he’d purchased in town the previous day. But when he threw the barn door open and looked in the corner where he’d dumped the bag of mixed seeds, he found it gone. Hal searched the entire barn, his chicken coop and the area around both. There was no sack of birdseed. “Am I cuckoo,” he mused, scratching his beak, “or did someone steal my seed?” He could not detect any footprints inside or around his barn, other than the ones he’d made in his search for the missing sack. And the short, gravel driveway that led from his home to the dirt road out front seemed to be devoid of any tire tracks, except for the ones he’d laid down with his pick-up truck the previous afternoon. It was an awful heavy sack of seed for one man or woman to carry too far on foot, so Hal’s suspicions immediately fell on his four neighbors who lived in relatively close proximity to his place. He started off on his quest to find the dirty bird who’d filched his seed, flying across the road and up the driveway of his nearest neighbor, Tor Hansen. “Hey, Tor, have you seen my bag of birdseed!?” he yelled into the screened front door of Tor’s house. The man’s huge body loomed into view behind the wire mesh. “You dumb cluck! Why would I want birdseed? I’ve got forty acres of sunflowers growing out back. The last thing I need is a flock birds. And I don’t appreciate a quack like you bringing them into the neighborhood.” Hal regarded the man’s angry, bearded face. Tor had never been a friendly giant neighbor. “Well … you’ve got a canary, don’t you? I can hear it singing right now.” “Tweeter? He isn’t going to eat a fifty-pound sack of birdseed in a month of Sundays.” “Aha!” Hal crowed. “How’d you know it was a ‘fifty-pound’ sack of birdseed that was missing?” Tor snorted. “I saw you draggin’ it into your barn from my front window yesterday. I’ve got eagle eyes, see.” And with that, the man slammed the inner door in Hal’s face. Hal trudged up the road to the neighbor adjoining the west side of his property, Billy Mumms. As he walked across the man’s green, trimmed front yard, he glanced up at the two large birdhouses sitting atop twenty-foot poles on either side of the lawn. “Hal,” Billy said, bobbing his head in greeting. The angular man with the hawk nose was just coming out of the front door of his house as Hal arrived, a watering can, not a sack of birdseed, in his hand. “Somebody waddled off with a bag of birdseed I just bought,” Hal explained. “Have you seen anyone carrying something like that around, Billy?” The man gave a quick shake of his bony head, eyes darting left and right as he watered the roses that decorated the front of his house. “Hey, Sylvester, get out of there!” he chirped at his cat, hiding amongst the rose bushes. Hal looked up at the birdhouses again. There were four or five purple martins fluttering around the towering feather-nesters. “Say, what’d you feed all those purple martins, Billy?” he casually asked. “There sure are a lot of them.” Billy cocked his head. “Nothing; they eat mosquitoes and other flying insects.” Hal whacked a bloodsucker that had just landed on his arm. “I guess they don’t get all of them,” he said. “Nope. Not all.” Hal walked back down the road, past his and Tor’s property, to Cheryl Judson’s place. The sixty year-old widow lived by herself in a small bungalow just east of Hal’s modest spread. He found her in her backyard, chopping wood. “What’s up, Hal?” Cheryl asked, wiping the sweat from her brow with one hand, clutching her twin-bladed axe with the other. The razor-sharp blades glinted in the sun.\n \nHal glanced from the axe to the creek that ran in back of Cheryl’s house. There was a mama duck and seven fuzzy baby ducks floating close to the far bank of the creek. “Uh, you haven’t seen a fifty-pound bag of birdseed around, have you, Cheryl? I’m missing one.” The woman spat on the ground and ran her finger along one of the blades of the axe. “I don’t have a need for your birdseed, if that’s what you’re squawking about, Hal. I don’t encourage birds or waterfowl – their chirping and quacking keeps me up nights.” “No! No,” Hal squeaked. “I’m not accusing anyone.” He skirted around the woman, closer to the babbling brook, interested in getting a better look at the ducklings. “I’m just, you know … asking around.” Cheryl grunted and placed another piece of firewood on the chopping block. She swung the axe down with a heavy thunk, cleaving the wood clean in two. As Hal watched, the mama duck and her brood swam across the creek towards him, quacking eagerly. “Guess you’ll be going,” Cheryl said, shouldering her axe. “Guess so,” Hal agreed.

The eccentric forty something year old owned a huge, ramshackle house and two equally ramshackle greenhouses. He grew and sold exotic plants, when he wasn’t working on some other project. Today, Hal could see, the chunky man was working on constructing what looked like another greenhouse in the field behind his home. “More space for your Venus flytraps and pitcher plants, Stan?” Hal asked. Stan dropped his saw and shook Hal’s hand, always eager to explain his latest project to any passerby. “No, sir. I’m building an aviary. What do you think of that?” “Really?” Hal responded, with actual interest. “Yes, sir. I’ve already got two scarlet macaws, and I’m going to start breeding them. Here, I’ll show you.” Stan led Hal inside his house and introduced him to two large, colorful birds perched in his kitchen. “Aren’t they beautiful?” he raved. “They are,” Hal agreed, admiring the birds’ bright red, blue and yellow plumage. “And they’re just the start. I’m going to raise all kinds of exotic parrots and cockatoos and such.” “Really? I guess you’re going to need a lot of birdseed, then – to feed them all?” Hal slyly asked. “Awk! Nuts and fresh fruit only, please!” the larger of the two birds cawed in reply, shocking Hal. “They’re pretty picky about their diet,” Stan cackled. “Uh-huh,” Hal said as he and the bird exchanged beady-eyed stares. “Awk! Don’t be a stranger!” it cawed, as Hal exited the house. On the walk back to his own home, Hal thought about all he’d seen and heard during his inquiries.

He found her in her backyard, chopping wood. “What’s up, Hal?” Cheryl asked, wiping the sweat from her brow with one hand, clutching her twin-bladed axe with the other. The razor-sharp blades glinted in the sun.\n \nHal glanced from the axe to the creek that ran in back of Cheryl’s house. There was a mama duck and seven fuzzy baby ducks floating close to the far bank of the creek. “Uh, you haven’t seen a fifty-pound bag of birdseed around, have you, Cheryl?

Today, Hal could see, the chunky man was working on constructing what looked like another greenhouse in the field behind his home. “More space for your Venus flytraps and pitcher plants, Stan?” Hal asked. Stan dropped his saw and shook Hal’s hand, always eager to explain his latest project to any passerby. “No, sir. I’m building an aviary. What do you think of that?” “Really?” Hal responded, with actual interest. “Yes, sir. I’ve already got two scarlet macaws, and I’m going to start breeding them. Here, I’ll show you.” Stan led Hal inside his house and introduced him to two large, colorful birds perched in his kitchen. “Aren’t they beautiful?” he raved. “They are,” Hal agreed, admiring the birds’ bright red, blue and yellow plumage. “And they’re just the start. I’m going to raise all kinds of exotic parrots and cockatoos and such.” “Really? I guess you’re going to need a lot of birdseed, then – to feed them all?” Hal slyly asked. “Awk! Nuts and fresh fruit only, please!” the larger of the two birds cawed in reply, shocking Hal. “They’re pretty picky about their diet,” Stan cackled. “Uh-huh,” Hal said as he and the bird exchanged beady-eyed stares. “Awk! Don’t be a stranger!” it cawed, as Hal exited the house. On the walk back to his own home, Hal thought about all he’d seen and heard during his inquiries. And then, suddenly, he stopped in his tracks and snapped his fingers, realizing that one of his neighbors had lied to him. He tapped the side of his own beak in recognition – knowing now which neighbor had flown the coop with his sack of birdseed.\nCheryl Judson lied to Hal when she said that she didn’t ‘encourage birds or waterfowl. The ducks’ behavior in the creek in back of her property proves she lied: they’d swum across the water towards Hal when he had approached them, as if expecting to be fed. That meant they were used to being fed by humans, like Cheryl.\nNormally, any wild bird or animal will instinctively retreat when a human approaches, as the ducks in Hal’s pond did. But their behavior will change if they come to see humans as a source of food. Like a duck to water, so, too, will quackers enthusiastically take to human-offered birdseed.\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What the thief had to do  \n • Enter the barn on foot – there were no fresh tyre-marks, so nobody drove in.  \n • Carry or drag a very heavy 50-lb sack far enough that Hal could not see it anywhere on his own property.  \n • Do it without leaving obvious footprints (the ground is gravelly and hard-packed around the barn).  \n →  The culprit therefore almost certainly lives immediately next to Hal and could slip straight back onto his or her own land without ever setting foot on the drive or the public road.\n\n2.  Who actually needs birdseed?  \n • Tor Hansen – grows forty acres of sunflowers; regards birds as pests; owns one pet canary that would take months to finish even a small bag. Motive weak.  \n • Billy Mumms – keeps purple-martin houses; martins eat insects, not seed. Motive nonexistent.  \n • Stan Mifflin – keeps macaws; Stan himself – and even one of the birds – says they are fed nuts and fruit. Large parrots certainly will crack seeds, but Stan has already invested in the proper food and is proud of his set-up; if he needed seed he would simply buy the correct (more expensive) parrot mix, not steal cheap mixed birdseed. Motive doubtful.  \n • Cheryl Judson – claims she dislikes birds and waterfowl, yet a mother duck and seven ducklings on the creek behind her house swim eagerly toward any human who approaches her bank. Ducks only do that when they have been repeatedly hand-fed. 50 lb of mixed seed would be perfect duck feed. Clear motive – she has been secretly encouraging the ducks.\n\n3.  Who lied?  \n • Tor’s statement about seeing the 50-lb label is plausible.  \n • Billy makes no suspicious statements.  \n • Stan’s birds back up his story.  \n • Cheryl flatly says, “I don’t encourage birds or waterfowl – their chirping and quacking keeps me up nights.”  \n   The ducks’ behaviour proves the opposite is true. Therefore Cheryl lied.\n\n4.  Who had the easiest opportunity?  \n Cheryl lives right next to Hal on the east; she is strong enough to swing an axe, so hauling a 50-lb sack a few dozen yards at night would be easy. She could walk straight from Hal’s barn into the trees along the creek and be on her own land almost immediately, leaving no tracks on the drive.\n\n5.  Deduction  \n The only neighbour with motive, opportunity and a proven lie is Cheryl Judson.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTor Hansen, Billy Mumms, Cheryl Judson, Stan Mifflin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCheryl Judson\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nThe evening Hal unloaded his newly purchased 50-lb sack of mixed birdseed, Cheryl Judson noticed him from her yard.  \nCheryl had secretly been feeding the wild ducks that use the creek behind her bungalow.  She was running out of seed and did not want Hal—or anyone—to know she was encouraging the noisy waterfowl she publicly complains about.  \n\nAfter dark she crossed the quiet country road on foot, slipped into Hal’s unlocked barn, hoisted the sack onto her shoulder and carried it back the short distance to her own woodshed.  Because she never set foot on the gravel drive and stayed on the hard ground between the two properties, she left no distinguishable footprints or tyre tracks.  \n\nThe next morning, while chopping wood, Cheryl was surprised by Hal’s visit but stuck to her story that she “doesn’t encourage birds.”  Unfortunately, the mother duck and her seven ducklings, now accustomed to Cheryl’s hand-outs, swam straight toward Hal expecting breakfast, exposing Cheryl’s lie and identifying her as the thief.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Tor Hansen already has an over-abundance of seed from his sunflower crop and actively dislikes wild birds.  His solitary canary could never justify stealing 50 lb of mixed seed.  His knowledge of the sack’s weight is easily explained by seeing the label when Hal dragged it in.  \n\n• Billy Mumms’ purple martins live exclusively on insects; providing seed would not attract or feed them.  Billy was calmly watering roses when Hal arrived and had no motive to haul away a bulky sack he could not use.  \n\n• Stan Mifflin’s macaws (and future parrots) eat specialised mixes of nuts, fruit and some large seeds, not the cheap, tiny-grain blend Hal bought.  Stan is proud of his birds and their diet; he would simply purchase suitable food from his exotic-pet supplier.  Nothing in Stan’s behaviour or statements is inconsistent, and the talking macaw itself supports his claim.  \n\nOnly Cheryl had a clear motive, direct access on foot, the physical strength, and—most tellingly—a demonstrable lie revealed by the ducks’ trusting behaviour.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
