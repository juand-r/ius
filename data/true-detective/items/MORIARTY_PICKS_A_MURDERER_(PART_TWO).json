      "content": "Professor Moriarty was pleased with the criminal he had selected to rid London, once and for all, of Sherlock Holmes. Fastidious Fred Fielder was, as his nickname implied, a man who could dress the part, any part. He could be at home in a drawing room in London’s elite West End, or he could disguise himself in a number of costumes to fit into any locale. Furthermore, he was not known in London, having committed his larcenies and occasional murders in Liverpool. Yes, Fastidious Fred was the man for the job. And he’d won the right to do the job, and earn a large amount of money, in a contest carefully arranged by Moriarty. Now, Fastidious Fred’s preparations had been made: He’d sent tickets for a violin concert to Sherlock Holmes. The show was scheduled for the following night. The bait should be irresistible—Holmes loved music if indeed he loved anything or anyone, and the featured soloist, Sarasate, was his special favorite. Sarasate played the violin like that wizard Paganini had done, captivating audiences. And so the trap was set. Fastidious Fred’s plan was in action. Soon, Moriarty would never again have to worry about Holmes spoiling his criminal plans. ***** Sherlock Holmes and Dr. James Watson were looking forward to enjoying the evening of fine violin playing by the virtuoso Sarasate. The tickets had been delivered the previous day by messenger. If asked, the messenger reported as he handed over the envelope, he was only to say they were from an admirer of the great consulting detective. For his trouble, the messenger had been given the generous sum of one shilling. Dr. Watson had advised strongly against accepting the tickets. “Just think, Holmes,” he said, “this may compromise your reputation. If word got about that you were accepting expensive tickets like this from anonymous admirers …” “I hardly think so, Watson,” Holmes replied. “And in fact, I was looking forward to this concert. Sarasate is quite the finest violinist playing in the concert halls today. It is a privilege to hear him, and you know, when I sent over to buy tickets a few days ago, they were all sold out.” “Were they?” “They were. This unexpected gift suggests several possibilities, Watson. One of which is what they purport to be at face value.” Watson snorted. “It seems to me that someone had the tickets, and then just decided not to use them. It was one of your admirers, surely. A nice gesture, I call it.” “Well, you are partly right. Someone had the seats, and then sent them to us just yesterday. It could have been simply a generous gesture. But since the concert has been sold out for several days, my anonymous admirer has had these tickets for a while—long enough to formulate a plan, I should think. So we cannot exclude the possibility of a more sinister purpose.” “Good heavens, Holmes. Do you mean that this may actually be a trap of some sort?” “I do hope so, Watson. Things have been tedious of late. The music will be entertaining, and it could just sharpen our wits for what may happen later in the evening.” ***** To Watson’s amazement, as the two men had descended from their quarters to Baker Street, a hansom cab awaited them. “It’s all arranged, gentlemen,” said the smartly dressed cab driver. He shifted the reins into his left hand to lift his hat to Holmes and Watson. “You’ll be at the concert hall in a jiffy.” “And will you be taking us back after the concert?” Holmes asked. “I know nothing about that, sir,” the cabbie replied, “so you should probably hire your own cab for the return.” “More and more interesting,” Holmes muttered, as he and Dr. Watson entered the cab. Upon arriving at the concert hall, Holmes stopped at the ticket office. “Why do that, old man? We’ve got our tickets already,” said Watson. Holmes had a quick conversation with the ticket seller, then returned to where Watson stood. “She remembers it perfectly well, Watson, even though the sale was five days ago. She notices details; all the more so since she is not allowed to leave her ticket booth during performances, in case a latecomer arrives. We have special box seats, it appears. Right next to the Royal Box, in fact, and this very box was specifically requested by the purchaser. And the curious thing is that there are three seats in our box, and all three were sold at the same time.” “Who bought them?” “A man in his mid-forties, tall and well dressed.” Holmes spun his mental file of suspects, his brain a computer before computers were invented. “Yes, the problem is more and more interesting. I wonder, now...” They were shown to their box by the theater usher. Holmes noticed a plainclothes policeman whom he recognized standing on duty just outside the Royal Box. “I hope you will enjoy the concert, gentlemen,” the usher said, pocketing the tip that Watson gave him. Closing the door behind them, he added, “I’ll see you at intermission, if you would like to order drinks.” Holmes waited a moment, got up from his seat, left the box, and approached the policeman outside the Royal Box. Yes, he learned, the Queen was expected to be in attendance. No, it had not been announced. She would arrive during the intermission. “Then there is just enough time,” Holmes said. He scribbled a note to Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard, and gave it to the policeman to deliver. Holmes then he settled down next to Dr. Watson to enjoy the concert. Loud applause followed the final notes of the first half of the concert. The concertgoers gradually stood and stretched. Several began to make their way to the bar, others headed outside for a breath of fresh air. “So you got my note, Inspector Lestrade?” Holmes asked as the inspector approached through the crowd with several of his men. “Yes, indeed,” the Scotland Yard detective answered. “The policeman on duty has been with us for years, and is one of our most reliable men. I hope we are in good time.” He joined Watson and Holmes in the third seat of their box. Their usher peered in to see that everything was all right. Then, a few minutes later, he returned with a tray holding three drinks, proclaiming, “Compliments of the house.” “I could prolong the puzzle, gentlemen,” said Holmes, “but that would not be right, with Her Majesty expected. You should perhaps make an arrest, Lestrade. Then we will surely all enjoy the rest of the concert.” He whispered something to Lestrade. As the policemen went to make the arrest, Holmes leaned over the rail of the box, searching the audience below. As expected he saw Professor Moriarty in the audience, regaining his seat. Holmes smiled, Moriarty frowned, and each man knew that another Moriarty plot had been foiled by the great detective, Sherlock Holmes. Raising his drink, Dr. Watson asked Holmes what had happened.",

Motive\n   • Professor Moriarty wants Holmes dead.  \n   • Fastidious Fred Fielder has been hired – and paid handsomely – to do the killing.  \n   • None of the other people named (cab driver, ticket seller, policeman, usher employed by the hall) has any reason to murder Holmes.\n\n2. Opportunity\n   • The killer must be able to get physically close enough to Holmes to strike during the very short interval before the Queen’s arrival, because after that the royal guard would be everywhere.  \n   • A shot or knife-thrust in a crowded, well-lit concert hall would be noticed at once; poison in a drink is the only “invisible” method.  \n   • Only one person is in a position to hand Holmes and Watson anything to consume: the usher who brings in “Compliments of the house” drinks although no order was placed.  \n   • The cab driver, ticket seller and constable never come nearer than arm’s-length through glass or from the driver’s seat, so they cannot administer poison.\n\n3. Physical evidence / behaviour\n   • Three seats were bought together although only two tickets were sent to Baker Street.  The third seat was clearly meant for the assassin, who would need to sit beside the victims.  \n   • But if the killer sits in the box he will be noticed; therefore he must adopt a role that allows him to step in and out of the box naturally – an usher.  \n   • The ticket-seller’s description of the buyer (“mid-forties, tall, well dressed”) matches nothing we have seen – because that was Fred before he changed costume.  \n   • The usher twice checks on the occupants, the second time with a tray of drinks.  An ordinary usher does not carry drinks; that is the job of the bar staff.  His eagerness to supply unasked-for beverages is the smoking gun.\n\n4. Holmes’s deductions\n   • Holmes learns that the Queen will arrive halfway through the interval.  A murder in the box next to the Royal Box, discovered just after Her Majesty’s entrance, would create maximum scandal – exactly Moriarty’s style.  \n   • Knowing Moriarty employs a master of disguise, Holmes realises the killer is already in the theatre in some guise that gives him access to the victims during the interval.  The only candidate is the usher.  \n   • Holmes sends for Lestrade, arranges for police to be present when the drinks arrive, and has the usher arrested.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFastidious Fred Fielder (master of disguise), The Theatre Usher, The Hansom Cab Driver, The Ticket Seller, The Policeman outside the Royal Box\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nFastidious Fred Fielder, alias “the theatre usher”\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Five days before the concert Fastidious Fred, acting on Moriarty’s orders, buys all three seats in the box adjoining the Royal Box.  \n2. Yesterday he sends two of those tickets to Holmes, keeping one for himself.  He also hires a cab to be waiting at 221B, making the whole evening appear “pre-arranged” and thus innocuous.  \n3. On the night, Fred arrives early at the hall in a new disguise – a theatre usher’s uniform – and persuades the real usher assigned to that floor to swap places or simply sends him on an errand.  As an usher he can enter Holmes’s box without attracting notice.  \n4. During the first half he keeps watch.  At intermission he enters, supposedly to take refreshment orders, and then returns with three glasses of wine laced with a fast-acting, tasteless poison.  \n5. Just as he presents the tray, Inspector Lestrade (summoned by Holmes) appears and occupies the empty third seat.  Holmes whispers his conclusion; Lestrade’s men seize the “usher.” In his pockets are found the cyanide bottle and the unused third ticket proving he bought the entire box.  \n6. The Queen arrives to a peaceful hall, while Moriarty, watching from below, realises his hired assassin has failed and been unmasked once more by Sherlock Holmes.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Hansom Cab Driver – merely hired to collect two gentlemen and deliver them; had no further contact or opportunity to poison or attack.  \n• Ticket Seller – confined to her booth throughout the performance; her only role was selling the tickets five days earlier.  \n• Policeman outside the Royal Box – personally known to both Holmes and Lestrade, on continuous guard duty where everyone could see him; never entered Holmes’s box and had no access to the drinks.  \n• Therefore none of them had both motive and opportunity.  Only the “usher” – in reality Fastidious Fred Fielder – satisfied every requirement for the crime.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
          "length_warning": "",
          "model": "o3",
          "reveal_segment": "Holmes was right to suspect a hidden motive for the concert tickets from his anonymous admirer. One of the persons who Holmes and Watson dealt with was the would-be killer in disguise, Fastidious Fred Fielder, hired by Moriarty to kill the great detective. It could not be the Hansom Cab Driver, since he was merely chosen to deliver Holmes and Watson to the theater. He made no arrangement to pick them up again after the performance. The Ticker Seller was helpful to Holmes, and she could not leave her ticket selling booth during the performance. Similarly, the Policeman was well situated to do harm, but he was a trusted, known man, according to Inspector Lestrade. Holmes knew him by sight.\n\nThat leaves the Theater Usher. He was the killer in disguise, and the drinks that he served contained poison. The murders were even to have occurred in the presence of the Queen, whose arrival at the end of intermission would have caused a great stir, which would soon have given way to panic as the murdered men were discovered in the very next box. It would have been the triumph of Professor Moriarty’s criminal career. Instead, it marked another failure in his duel of wits with Sherlock Holmes."
