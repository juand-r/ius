      "content": "John Elway grabbed the center's snap. His guard blocked the tackles while Elway searched desperately for an open receiver. Suddenly, he spotted Smith breaking across the field. Elway hurtled a long pass down the field. Completion! Elway huddled with the team, and decided to try a handoff. Ignoring the crowd, he focused only on his team, the ball, and the chosen play. The center snapped the ball, and Elway turned for the hand-off and hoped for the best. Touchdown! Uncle Charlie could describe the whole game as though he'd played it himself. “That was his last game,” Charlie said. “After 14 years, Elway had played in four Super Bowl games, and he'd lost every year. Then he came back one more time, just to prove that he could win the big game again. He was the only quarterback who ever started in five Super Bowl games.” “And the only man you ever loved more than me,” teased Aunt Mary. Uncle Charlie laughed. His passion was watching professional football, and this year he'd bought himself a widescreen TV just for watching his favorite team, the Denver Broncos. Even though they didn't make it into the post-season playoff games this year, Charlie never missed a chance to watch the Super Bowl; even if it was only so he could compare the teams' quarterbacks to John Elway! He'd invited me to watch his first widescreen Super Bowl — which was a relief. Eight years earlier, when I was seven years old, my parents had taken me for my first visit to Uncle Charlie’s. Running through his living room, screaming about imaginary monsters, I had crashed into the cabinet with his TV set. The cabinet toppled forward, and I watched in horror as the front of the TV smashed to the ground. So today I was relieved that Uncle Charlie let me anywhere near his expensive new television! “It arrived yesterday,” Charlie said, pointing to the enormous plastic cover that he'd unwrapped from the screen when Phil, the burly delivery man, set it up. “They'd set it up in the guest cottage out back; but for the big game, I decided it looked better in my den. The picture is spectacular! The teams are going to look huge!” But as Uncle Charlie opened the door to his den, we were greeted by a terrible surprise. His television was gone! Sunday sunshine poured into the empty space in the room through its only other door, which stood wide open. Charlie rushed through the door, and the neighbor's dog began barking fiercely. The dog stood behind a fence barely four feet away. To the right, the fence joined Uncle Charlie's house, so there was only one other way to travel with the TV: left towards the street! “Darn it,” Charlie said, since he couldn't avoid stepping in the enormous puddle of mud around the door. We looked for muddy tracks towards the street, but there weren't any. “Someone escaped with my TV — and without leaving us a clue!” Charlie wailed. I hated to see my uncle so unhappy, but every problem is also an opportunity. If I could deduce who'd stole his TV, it'd more than make up for the one I'd destroyed when I was seven — once and for all! Maybe I was like John Elway in Super Bowl XXXIII because I, too, had something to prove. “Who knew you had a widescreen TV?” I asked Charlie. \"You said you've only had your TV since yesterday! “That's right!” said Charlie excitedly. “Maybe we'll solve this yet.” He thought for a moment, then said, “My neighbor Rick! Sometimes he teases me that I care too much about football. I'd invited him over to see the new screen yesterday. Maybe he came back and grabbed it as a practical joke. “Uncle Charlie grabbed his winter jacket from the hook on the wall, and then we walked next door to pay a visit on Rick. When we rang Rick's bell, he surprised us by opening the door in a football jersey — the one he'd worn as a college football player. “I never got tackled!” Rick liked to brag —mainly because he'd spent the entire season sitting on the bench. They'd called him “Rick the Brick” because he weighed 240 pounds; though, maybe they'd also thought he was dumb as a brick. “I'm undefeated!” Rick shouted, opening the door. In his living room was a regular 13-inch TV screen, where he was obviously planning to watch the game. But Rick looked even more like a football player today for another reason. “What happened to your arm?” Charlie asked. Rick's face turned bright red. “I was throwing some passes with my nephew last night, and I tripped on a sprinkler and broke my arm,\" he said sadly, lifting a white plaster cast held in place by a sling around his neck. He showed us the autographs he'd gotten on the cast from the staff at the hospital. Rick didn't have a lot of other friends. “Did you see anyone strange approaching my house?” Charlie asked. Rick shook his head no, but he also said that he'd been sleeping for most of the morning. Looking at Rick's own set, we realized the game was about to start. Uncle Charlie quickly said good-bye, leaving Rick to his one-man Super Bowl party. But on the way out, Uncle Charlie got an idea: “There's one other person who knew I had the TV,” he pointed out: “Phil the delivery man! Do you think there's any chance he came back here this morning and grabbed it for himself? He's big enough to carry it off — and it'd be an easy way for him to sell the same TV twice!” We saw Aunt Mary waiting for us as we approached the house. “Maybe Uncle Charlie's just teasing you,” Aunt Mary suggested. “Is there any evidence that he even had a TV here? And suddenly the answer hit me. “I can solve the mystery of the missing TV!” I told Uncle Charlie. “And I'll do it before the game even starts!”",

Establish the facts  \n• The widescreen set really was in the den—its unopened protective plastic sat on the floor.  \n• The only door out of the den opened to the yard where the neighbour’s dog stands four-feet away behind a fence; to leave that way anyone must step through a large muddy puddle.  \n• There are no muddy footprints leading away.  \n• Therefore the set never passed through that doorway.\n\n2. Ask whether another exit exists  \n• The den has only the one outside door and the interior door through which the family entered.  \n• If the set had gone through the interior door, the culprit would still have had to take it past the family in the house; no one saw that.  \n• So the only logical place for the set is still inside the den itself.\n\n3. Who could hide it inside the den?  \n• Someone who had been in the den after it was moved there, knew its exact position and had time before Charlie opened the door this morning.  \n• That describes only Aunt Mary, who was already in the house, not Rick (next door) and not Phil (delivery man).\n\n4. Motive  \n• Mary had just joked that Charlie loved football more than her; hiding the television is the perfect “practical joke” to make that point.\n\n5. Opportunity & physical capability  \n• Mary was in the house, unhindered by a broken arm (unlike Rick) and needed only seconds to slide the set behind the curtain and pull the outside door open to fake a theft—no heavy outdoor carrying required, no footprints created.\n\n6. Eliminate the others  \n• Rick’s arm is freshly broken; even without the mud-print problem he could not man-handle a widescreen television.  \n• Phil delivered to the guest cottage; he had no reason to know the set had been moved, and he would have left wheel or boot prints in the mud and would have set off or at least been barked at by the dog.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAunt Mary, Rick (the neighbour), Phil (the delivery man)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nAunt Mary\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nKnowing Charlie’s devotion to football and still teasing him about “loving the game more than her,” Aunt Mary decided on a harmless prank.  \nEarly Sunday morning she entered the den, unplugged the new widescreen, rolled it a few feet across the floor and hid it behind the long curtain on the opposite wall. She then opened the outside door wide to suggest a hurried getaway, making sure the mud puddle outside would mislead Charlie into thinking a thief had escaped that way. Because she never took the set outside, no footprints were made, no dog was disturbed and no neighbour saw anything. When Charlie later opened the den, the set seemed to have vanished. Mary kept silent while Charlie and the narrator rushed around accusing Rick and Phil, then finally revealed the truth when the logical impossibility of an external theft became obvious.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nRick: A freshly broken arm in a full plaster cast prevents him from lifting or carrying a heavy widescreen set. He was at home preparing for the game and would have had to cross mud and dog territory, leaving prints and provoking barking—none of which happened.\n\nPhil: He delivered the set to the guest cottage and did not know it had been moved to the den. To steal it he would have needed to return, locate it, carry it past the barking dog and through the mud, all without leaving tracks. No such evidence exists.\n\nTherefore only Aunt Mary had the motive, knowledge, opportunity and the ability to remove the TV without ever taking it out of the room—simply by hiding it.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "“Uncle Charlie's not telling a fib,\" I told Aunt Mary. \"I know there was a TV here, because I saw its enormous plastic cover!”\n“I bet Rick would love watching the game on my giant screen,” Uncle Charlie speculated.\n“But Rick's arm is in a cast!” I pointed out. “Even if he'd wanted to steal your TV, he wouldn't be able to carry it to his house.”\n\"What about Phil, the delivery man?\" Uncle Charlie asked. “Do you think he came back and stole the TV he'd just delivered?”\n“It couldn't be Phil the Delivery man,” I said. “He delivered the TV to your guest cottage. So even if he'd wanted to steal your set, he'd never have known that you'd moved it into your den!”\nThe game was going to start in less than two minutes, but I wasn't worried. “There's one more reason it couldn't be Phil or Rick,” I announced: “Even if they were able to squeeze the TV into that four-foot opening by the fence, and without anyone hearing the barking dogs, they'd still have to walk through that giant puddle — and leave some muddy footprints.”\n“But there weren't any!” said Uncle Charlie. “It's as though the TV ... never left the room!” laughed Aunt Mary. “I just hid it behind the curtain on the other side of the room. It's still plugged in. If you hurry, you can still catch the coin toss.”\nUncle Charlie laughed. “Do you hate my football games that much?”\n“Of course not,” said Mary. “It was just too good a joke to pass up. I don't really think you love football more than you love me.”\n“You know I don't,” Charlie said fondly. “In fact, to prove it, why don't we skip the game altogether. Today's the one day we can have the park all to ourselves, because everyone else will be staying home, watching television!\"\nMary blushed with excitement, but she wanted Charlie to be happy. “Are you sure?” she asked. “Don't you want to stay home and watch the big game? After all, it's the Super Bowl!”\n“Nah,” said Uncle Charlie. “John Elway isn't even playing!”"
