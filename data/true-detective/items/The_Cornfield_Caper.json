      "content": "Joe Farmer walked aimlessly through the freshly cut corn maze, his boots sinking deep into the muddy earth. Joe, however, didn't notice his sinking situation, or the trail of deep footprints he left behind him. His attention was focused on the small open box in his right hand, and the diamond engagement ring inside it. \"I am the luckiest man in the world,\" he said to himself, \"… of all the guys here, she picked me.\" She being the one woman in the area that every guy in his town (including his brothers) wished to be picked by, the beautiful Ms. Maria Irene. \"Maria, will you marry me? … Will you marry me, Maria? … Maria, I love you. Marry me?\" Joe spoke each of the questions aloud, trying to determine which one he thought sounded best. Where would he ask? Would he get down on one knee? A cracking sound nearby, however, interrupted his train of thought. He stopped and looked around in all directions for the source of the sound, but the corn was too thick to see anything other than the short path he was on. \"Hello?\" Joe called out. \"Is someone there?\" Joe wasn't sure why, but being in the corn maze always made him feel uneasy, even though it was on his family’s farm. Even though he and his brothers had spent their childhood chasing one another through the fields. Another sound. This one was closer. Joe was just about to turn around and head back for the farmhouse, when he felt a sudden burst of pain erupt in his head. He blacked out before he could turn around to identify his attacker. \"Joe! Are you out here? Joe?\" Joe could hear his little brother, Billy, calling out to him from somewhere off in the corn maze. Slowly he opened his eyes to see that he was face up in the muddy path. \"I'm over here,\" he shouted as he lifted himself to his feet. He had just started to brush the dirt off his pants, when he noticed the ring box he had been holding was gone. He instantly began to search the area for it, but could see nothing other than his footprints and the footprints of the person who must have attacked him. He bent down to study the offender’s tracks. They appeared slightly less deep and closer together than his prints, but the impressions were too smeared for Joe to be able to determine the tread or size of the shoe. \"Joe, there you are.\" Joe looked up to see Billy coming towards him. \"I've been looking all over for you. Austin has lunch ready. Everybody else is already inside,\" Billy said. Joe had started to form a reply, but Billy had already turned around and disappeared back toward the house. Joe spent a few more minutes alone looking for the ring, but he knew it was gone. Taken by the person who had hit him. When Joe entered the kitchen, his brothers were all seated at their places around the table. Nick, the oldest and biggest of the bunch by four inches and nearly fifty pounds, sat at the head of the table. Beside him sat the next oldest brother, Austin. He, like Nick, had inherited their father's size and was at least two inches taller than Joe. Opposite the table from Nick sat Billy, the youngest, but smartest boy of the family. \"Which one of you did it?\" Joe asked. \"Which of us did what?\" Nick replied. \"Which of you stole the ring?\" Joe was beginning to get angry now. \"What ring? Austin replied. \"The engagement ring. The one I got for Maria. One of you followed me out into the corn maze, hit me with something, and then made off with the ring I had been holding. You all have feelings for her, but she picked me. So tell me which one of you did it?\" \"Well it wasn't me.\" Austin said. \"I haven't left the house all day.\" \"And it wasn't me.\" Billy said. \"I was helping Austin with lunch in here, until I went to go find you, and then I got lost in the corn maze.\" \"It wasn't me, either.\" Nick said. \"I was outside, but I was over by the barn working on the tractor.\" Joe eyed them all, certain he now he knew who'd taken the ring.",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   •  All three brothers, Nick, Austin and Billy, admire Maria Irene – jealousy gives each of them a reason to keep Joe from proposing.  \n2.  Opportunity / Where-abouts at the critical moment  \n   •  Nick – says he was by the barn working on the tractor (outside, but the barn is on the far side of the farm, not near the corn maze).  \n   •  Austin – says he “hasn’t left the house all day.”  Billy corroborates that Austin was with him in the kitchen until Billy left to look for Joe.  \n   •  Billy – is the only one who admits being in the cornfield.  He left the kitchen “to find” Joe and was already in the maze when Joe regained consciousness.  \n3.  Physical evidence – the footprints  \n   •  Joe’s boots left deep, widely-spaced prints in the mud.  \n   •  The attacker’s prints were “slightly less deep and closer together.”  \n   •  Nick and Austin are both taller and heavier than Joe; their prints would have been at least as deep and their stride longer.  \n   •  Billy is the youngest, shortest and lightest; shallower, shorter-stride tracks match him alone.  \n4.  Logical inconsistencies in the alibis  \n   •  Billy claims he “got lost” in a maze the brothers have known since childhood – a very unlikely error.  \n   •  He also managed to arrive almost exactly where Joe was lying, which is hard to reconcile with being lost.  \n   •  Austin’s and Nick’s statements do not clash with any physical clue; Billy’s does.  \n5.  Timing  \n   •  Joe is struck and knocked out.  \n   •  Only a minute or two later he hears Billy calling for him from very nearby.  \n   •  That is consistent with Billy inflicting the blow, pocketing the ring, then calling Joe’s name to pretend innocence.  \n6.  Number of tracks  \n   •  When Joe inspected the mud he saw only two sets of prints – his own and the attacker’s.  No third set led up to the spot after the assault, meaning the person who later called his name was the same person who had already been standing there – i.e., Billy.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nNick Farmer, Austin Farmer, Billy Farmer\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nBilly Farmer\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nBilly noticed his brother walking toward the corn maze with the small velvet box and guessed what it contained.  Jealous of Joe’s impending proposal to the coveted Maria, he slipped away from the kitchen while Austin was finishing lunch.  Following Joe’s fresh, deep boot prints through the wet rows, Billy came up behind him, broke a cornstalk (the “cracking sound” Joe heard), and struck Joe on the head with it or with some other blunt object.  While Joe lay stunned in the mud, Billy snatched the ring box and stuffed it into his pocket.  Realising he needed an alibi, he waited a short distance away, then began to shout Joe’s name as if searching for him.  Hearing Joe reply, he walked back to the scene, repeated Austin’s message about lunch and hurried Joe toward the house, hoping the missing ring would simply be blamed on the unknown attacker.  Unfortunately for Billy, the depth and length of the muddy footprints – together with his implausible story about being lost – pointed straight at him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nNick – His greater height and weight rule him out; the attacker’s prints were notably lighter and shorter.  Nothing places him inside the maze, and his job on the tractor kept him on the opposite side of the farm.\n\nAustin – Every indication has him inside the house preparing the meal.  Billy himself confirms that Austin was in the kitchen up until Billy left.  Even had Austin slipped out, his size still contradicts the footprint evidence.\n\nTherefore, only the youngest brother, Billy Farmer, had the motive, the opportunity, and the matching physical evidence to be the attacker and thief.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
