      "content": "When Martin Caldwell got to his office on Monday morning, he felt as if he had just left minutes ago. Being a city detective called for long and sometimes boring investigations that often led nowhere. He had only had four hours of sleep and when he looked in the mirror in the men's room, he could tell it. With the bags under his eyes along with the weight he had gained he looked like a basset hound. What hair he had left was sprinkled with gray and his blue eyes were so red that they looked like a Florida road map. Along with his rumpled suit he had spilled coffee and mustard on his white shirt, but he couldn't seem to make himself care. \"Maybe nothing will happen today and I can steal a short nap,” he thought. He had closed the door and settled back in his chair with his feet on the desk when the phone began ringing. He let it trill on a few times hoping it would stop, but knowing it wouldn't. \"Detective Caldwell, I'm glad you finally made it to work this morning, and just in time too, there's been a bank robbery\" the deep voice said. Martin recognized the voice of Chief Jennings and started to protest, but having been on this earth for fifty-one years and knowing the chief, said only, \"where and when?” The chief told him that Macon Central Savings had been robbed only thirty minutes ago, about 9:47 a.m. He was to go and interview the witnesses and talk to the security guard about the heist. \"Maybe this will be quick and I can go home,” he thought. The bank was fairly new, having been built only two years ago in 1974 and he knew it well because he had a small retirement account there. Thus he was acquainted with the personnel and the bank president, Mr. Riley. When he entered, Mrs. Parker was sitting in one of the chairs along the wall and was being consoled by a pretty young Oriental girl that Martin recognized as a recently hired teller. In her sixty's and spry as ever, Mrs. Parker seemed relieved to see the detective and began telling what happened. \"I was alone up front behind the tellers counter when the thief suddenly burst in without saying a word and handed me a note, saying to put all of the money in the bag that he was carrying.\" Martin lifted his head and asked, \"did you say he?” Mrs. Parker smiled and answered, \"well, I'm not sure of course, because the thief didn't say a word and was wearing a hood and gloves that concealed his features. He just handed me the note and brandished a pistol at me, so I stuffed all of the money in the bag and then the robber ran out the door.” Martin also discovered that the security video wasn't operating and was being replaced by a newer system. Having gleaned everything of importance from Mrs. Parker, including the description of medium height and weight, a description that would fit a lot of people, he went looking for the security guard, a guy named Bill Thomas. Bill, who used to work at police headquarters but retired and now worked part time at the bank, was coming out of the bank president’s office and saw that Martin had arrived. \"Hey Bill, let me guess, you were in the john and didn't see anything, right?” Martin and Bill were old friends and had shared many cases together so they knew each other well. \"Aw, come on Martin, you know my routine so well that you already knew that. But I did get out in time to see the car speeding away and it was a 1976 Porsche 911, burgundy in color. I've never seen one that color before but that's what it was. My nephew has a 911 and I couldn't be mistaken.” Martin told Bill that he would talk to him later and went to use the phone. When Martin called the Department of Motor vehicles, he found out that there were only five 911's in the whole country that matched that description. All of them sold in Macon at the local dealership. When someone made a special order for the burgundy color a mistake was made and five were shipped and sold in 1976. The only difference in them was that one had an automatic transmissions and the others all had manual shifters which entailed using a clutch. Bill hadn't noticed the difference so Martin got the phone numbers of the owners and asked them to come down to the bank. He hoped that one of them wouldn't show up and maybe narrow the field, but they all agreed to come. Frankie Cole was the first to arrive because he worked at the nearby airport and just had a short commute. He was working in one of the back hangars as a mechanic but he was working alone and didn't have an alibi. His car was shiny and clean with a manual shifter and purred like a kitten when running. He seemed like an honest guy, but in this business you never knew. He was the right size but so far that didn't mean anything Amy Golden, a housewife and mother pulled in beside Frankie and shut off her motor. Her car also had a manual shifter and was identical except for a small faded decal in the rear window. She too seemed very pleasant. Again, the size matched. Although they were not with her at the time of the robbery, her aunt and uncle would vouch for her character she said and gave Martin their phone number. The third to arrive was Susan Barker who worked for Dr. Pitts down the road. She was indignant about having to leave her job to be interviewed and swore that she was working when the bank was robbed. She was a little larger in build than the other two but not much. Again, she had an identical car. Like the first two cars, the shifter had the H pattern on it with the numbers one through four and a reverse to the side. Jeremy Steele, a pimpled-faced young man was angry to have to come over for questioning. His girlfriend, a plump young blond named Tammy, drove him to the bank. When asked why Tammy drove him in, Jeremy pointed to the signature-covered cast on his left foot and said that he could not work the clutch with his broken foot. Unfortunately, Tammy was not able to vouch for his whereabouts at the time of the robbery. The last suspect to arrive was a young black college student named Lionel Jackson, who was on the way to school and didn't have a solid alibi either. His car was in perfect shape like the others. Very polite and, you guessed it, medium build and weight. Martin sat in the car and looked at the familiar PRNDL that was short for park, reverse, neutral, drive and low gears. Nothing was ever easy it seemed in these cases. Shaking his head, Martin walked back over to Bill and asked him what view he had of the car while it was racing away. \" I was running up behind it when the thief cranked up and sped off. But I'm sure that it didn't have anything on the rear window.” Martin trusted Bill's eyewitness account because of Bill's police training. \" Martin looked at the empty parking space behind the bank president's car and asked, \"did the thief put the car in reverse before leaving the parking space, or just go straight ahead?\" Bill frowned and thought for a moment before answering, \"nope, not a flicker of the back up lights, so no, no reverse.” After thinking about all of the testimonies of the suspects he said to Bill. \"Do you still have your old set of rusty handcuffs, I left mine at the station?” Bill smiled and said, \" So you know who did it huh?” Martin said. \"Sometimes you get lucky.\"",

You said there was nothing on the rear window. As for Susan Barker, she was at work when the robbery occurred, so she could not have done it. Jeremy has a cast on his foot. He not only could not drive, but the thief ran out of the bank. With a broken foot, he would not be running. I was still puzzled until I remembered something from my own experience. When shifting an automatic transmission into drive, the shifter slides past the reverse gear and causes the back up lights to flicker for an instant. Since you were sure that this didn't happen, this meant that the car that was used in the robbery was a manual transmission. Lionel’s car is an automatic so he was eliminated. That left only Frankie Cole who had to be the thief.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the pool of possible offenders.  Only the five owners of a burgundy 1976 Porsche 911 could have supplied the getaway car, so the suspects are:\n   • Frankie Cole • Amy Golden • Susan Barker • Jeremy Steele • Lionel Jackson  \n\n2. Fix the crucial eyewitness facts supplied by the armed-guard Bill Thomas.\n   a. Bill was directly behind the Porsche when the engine started.  \n   b. No back-up (reverse) lights ever flashed – the car did not pass through “R”.  \n   c. There was nothing at all on the rear window – no decals, stickers, etc.\n\n3. Compare those facts with each car.  \n   • Transmission  \n        – Lionel’s car is the only automatic.  An automatic must move its lever from P past R to D; the back-up lights would blink for an instant.  Because Bill saw no flash, the robber’s car had to be a manual.  ⇒ Lionel eliminated.  \n        – Jeremy’s car is a manual, but Jeremy is wearing a full cast on the left foot.  A left-foot cast prevents operating the clutch and certainly prevents sprinting from the bank.  ⇒ Jeremy eliminated.  \n   • Rear-window decal  \n        – Amy’s Porsche has a small faded decal on the rear glass.  Bill would have been staring right at it.  He swore the window was completely clear.  ⇒ Amy eliminated.  \n   • Solid alibi  \n        – Susan Barker was on duty in Dr. Pitts’s office, a fact the doctor can verify.  Taller build aside, a solid alibi clears her.  ⇒ Susan eliminated.  \n\n4. The only remaining owner whose Porsche is (a) manual, (b) decal-free, (c) drivable by the owner, and (d) unsupported by an alibi is Frankie Cole.  By the process of elimination—and with no conflicting evidence—Frankie must be the robber.\n\n5. Motive/opportunity:  Frankie was working alone in a rear airport hangar; no one could account for him between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m.  A mechanic’s pay is modest, and the airport is only minutes from the bank, giving both motive and opportunity.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nFrankie Cole, Amy Golden, Susan Barker, Jeremy Steele, Lionel Jackson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nFrankie Cole\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nOn Monday morning Frankie Cole left the airport hangar where he was supposedly working alone, drove his burgundy manual-shift 1976 Porsche 911 to Macon Central Savings and parked nose-out in a space behind the president’s car.  Wearing gloves and a hood, he entered the bank at 9:47 a.m., silently handed teller Mrs. Parker a note demanding cash and showed a pistol.  After she filled his bag he ran back outside, jumped into his Porsche (which was already in first gear), started the engine, released the clutch and drove straight out of the space without ever selecting reverse.  Because the car is a manual and because it carries no rear-window decal, Bill Thomas—chasing from behind—saw no momentary flash of back-up lights and no sticker on the glass, only the distinctive burgundy sports car accelerating away.  \n\nFrankie returned to the airport, wiped the car down, hid the money, and resumed work as if he had never left.  When the police rang the Porsche owners, he drove calmly to the bank, trusting that the lack of witnesses at the hangar would keep him safe.  Unfortunately for him, the transmission detail and the missing decal pointed straight at him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Amy Golden – Her Porsche carries a decal on the rear window; Bill emphatically saw no decal on the getaway car.  \n• Susan Barker – Dr. Pitts confirms she was at her desk throughout the pertinent time span.  \n• Jeremy Steele – A manual-shift Porsche requires clutch work with the left foot; Jeremy’s left foot is immobilised in a cast, and he could not have sprinted from the bank either.  \n• Lionel Jackson – His Porsche is the only automatic; selecting “Drive” from “Park” necessarily causes the reverse lights to blink, something Bill specifically did not see.  \n\nAll physical evidence and eyewitness observations clear these four, leaving only Frankie Cole as the bank robber.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "When Bill asked who it was, Martin explained the case. “Although she had no alibi, I was able to narrow the choice by eliminating Amy Golden because of the decal in the window. You said there was nothing on the rear window. As for Susan Barker, she was at work when the robbery occurred, so she could not have done it. Jeremy has a cast on his foot. He not only could not drive, but the thief ran out of the bank. With a broken foot, he would not be running. I was still puzzled until I remembered something from my own experience. When shifting an automatic transmission into drive, the shifter slides past the reverse gear and causes the back up lights to flicker for an instant. Since you were sure that this didn't happen, this meant that the car that was used in the robbery was a manual transmission. Lionel’s car is an automatic so he was eliminated. That left only Frankie Cole who had to be the thief.”"
