      "content": "The arsonist had the town police stumped. It was a series of vicious fires, set to produce a large ransom from the town. Already, several stores in the old Main Street commercial section had been hit. They were on a continuous block of stores on both sides of the street, with a common roof. One of them had burned nearly to the ground. Then there was a particularly vicious episode, when the fire department, distracted by a commercial fire, arrived too late at a residential fire three miles south of the city. The hallmark of that arson, rags soaked in kerosene, was the same as the fires set in the commercial section. Clearly, the arsonist was upping the ante. Clues were hard to come by, and the arsonist had called in a warning to the local radio station, KPKR. Anybody who helped the police would find their house or place of business was the next target. That’s when Inspector Samuels had his bright idea. He called me up. “Crusher,” he said, “why don’t you ask for clues through your column?” It seemed that our previous working together, to solve The Litterer Case, had given me real credibility with his boss, our Chief of Police. I am sure that they were both hearing from the Mayor as well. “Sure, Inspector, I’d be glad to help,” I said. That’s why I put in my advice column, Ask Martha, a request for help, for anyone who had seen or knew anything about the arsonist. People writing in were told to make duplicates of their letters, for identification, and to claim the reward money for the entry that helped the police solve the crime - if there was any help, that is. If you are wondering why a 6 foot 6, 265 pound former all state football player named Crusher Davis is writing the advice column under the name Ask Martha, you haven’t been on the job market lately! All I can say is, the money is all right, and I rather enjoy doling out advice, when there isn’t a football game or City Hall scandal to cover, that is. Fortunately, my identity as Martha was a secret, so my home was safe. Inspector Samuels briefed me on the fires. There was newspaper speculation, but precise details of the arson crimes had not been made public. There had been four so far, all in the current month of March. The first one, which broke out just after midnight on Sunday, March 1, was set in the commercial section on Main Street and did serious damage to Green’s Hardware Store, with smoke damage to adjacent stores. That one remained a mystery, for there were no demands for money or anything of that sort. It was just setting us up, I guess. On March 4, the arsonist struck once again, in the very same block. This time it was Hill’s Drug Store. It was late at night again, but the fire department was revved up for action, and had put an extra crew on the late shift. They were there within minutes of being called, and the fire was put out without much damage, except for some water damage from the sprinkler system. A call came to the police station, from a public phone, offering to stop the fires if a large sum of money was paid. A location was given for the answer to be dropped off, behind a loose brick in the schoolyard wall by the elementary school. The location was well chosen. Anybody there could see clearly in all directions for blocks. The police chose to ignore the call, and the arsonist struck again. This time, he struck twice, on March 11. It was that double arson I was telling you about. A fire was set, once again on Main Street, on the roof of the building that houses the Bradley Men’s Store. Fortunately a passerby saw it and called the fire department on his cell phone. Damage was contained, and the fire department was feeling good about that, when they were called about the residential fire on Sunnydale Drive, outside of town. While the fire department had been occupied with the commercial fire, the house burned to the ground. Fortunately, the family was out of town, and they had even taken their pets to be boarded during their trip. That was when I put the call for help in my Ask Martha column. Sure enough, there were four replies. I read them over carefully. All referenced the reward money that the Main Street Commercial Association was offering for information that led to identifying the arsonist. Inspector Samuels and I hoped that there would be a useful clue in one of those replies. Scared Stiff said that she had been driving along Main Street on March 11, when she had seen the fire break out at Bradley Men’s Store. It was a little after midnight. She could describe the arsonist, who was running out the front door. She said she had gotten a good look at him before he disappeared into a nearby alley. She wanted police protection, though, because he was a burly man, and she was, as she said, Scared Stiff. Watchful Waiter worked across the street from the elementary school, at the snack bar, which was still prospering despite the economic hard times. Kids never seemed to lose their appetites for fudgecicles and popsicles and had a few coins to pay for them. The Snack Shoppe had the sense to break open packages of these treats, so that they were for sale one fudgesicle or popsicle at a time. Looking out his store window a few days previously, Watchful Waiter had seen a woman look both ways, then climb the low schoolyard wall. This was late in the afternoon, after school had let out for the day. He had thought nothing about it, until the action was repeated a few days later. Now, he was wondering if this could have had anything to do with the arsons under investigation. He could describe the woman, and the second time it happened, he had made a note of her car’s license plate number. Keen Observer lived outside of town. He was driving home from a long trip, monitoring the police calls throughout the evening on his car shortwave radio. He listened all the way home, hearing about a residential fire, which bothered him until the address was clearly given. He thought it might be his home. Passing Sunnydale Drive, not far from his own home, he saw a man in a pickup truck watching the fire. Keen Observer could describe him fairly well, and looked forward to doing so. Minding My Own Business had a friend who worked the late shift at Hill’s Drug Store. After work they had seen a movie, then he had driven her back, as she had forgotten to lock a cabinet full of prescription medicines. It had bothered her all during the movie. When they got to the store, flames were billowing forth, so it was not possible to go inside. However, while she was at the door, he saw a man leaving from the drug store’s side door. Fortunately, Minding My Own Business didn’t believe that the arsonist, who looked quickly up and down the street, and then ran like a man possessed down the street, had seen him. Minding My Own Business had studied art in high school, and would be able to sketch the person he saw. I called Inspector Samuels. “Your hunch has paid off, Inspector. One of my readers can offer real help to you in solving this crime.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Whoever climbed the school-yard wall and poked around the hiding place behind the loose brick must be either  \n   • the arsonist himself/herself, or  \n   • a trusted accomplice who knew exactly where the extortion note had ordered the police to leave the answer.  \n   That spot had never been revealed to the public, therefore no innocent passer-by would have any reason even to suspect that a message might be hidden there.\n\n2. Watchful Waiter saw that person on two different afternoons and wrote down the car-licence number.  \n   The police, following up his information, would have learned the owner of the car – a woman.\n\n3. Among the four letter-writers only one is a woman: “Scared Stiff”.  \n   – She therefore fits Watchful Waiter’s observation.  \n   – She tried to look like a helpful, frightened citizen, but the facts she supplied are demonstrably false (she says she saw a “burly man” run out of the front door, although the arsonist had to leave over the roofs).  \n   – Giving a false story is exactly what the real criminal would do to throw the police off the scent and, at the same time, to pick up information about how much the authorities already knew.\n\n4. The other three tipsters can all be shown to have been merely mistaken guessers who repeated details already rumoured in the newspapers; none of them had secret knowledge.  \n   Only “Scared Stiff” possessed the secret knowledge of the hiding place – proven by her clandestine visits observed by Watchful Waiter.\n\n5. Motive: she was trying to extort “a large sum of money” from the town.  \n   Opportunity: her own letters show that she moved around Main Street after midnight.  \n   Physical evidence: kerosene-soaked rags, fingerprints or fibres from her car, and, above all, her presence at the drop site, tie her to the crimes.  \n   Alibi: she offers none – instead she manufactures a false story.\n\nTherefore the woman who signed herself “Scared Stiff” is the only person who had knowledge, motive and opportunity and who tried actively to misdirect the investigation.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nScared Stiff, Watchful Waiter, Keen Observer, Minding My Own Business, (unknown) store-owners\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\n“Scared Stiff” – real name later identified from the licence record as Patricia (Pat) Grant\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• 1 March – Pat Grant (alias “Scared Stiff”) climbs onto the continuous Main-Street roof-line, scatters kerosene-soaked rags above Green’s Hardware and sets them alight, testing the town’s response.  \n• 4 March – After repeating the performance over Hill’s Drug Store she telephones a ransom demand, instructing the police to leave their answer behind a loose brick in the elementary-school wall – a spot she can watch from a distance before walking over to collect any message.  \n• 5-10 March – In the late afternoons, when the playground is deserted, she twice scales the low wall and checks the hiding place; these are the two occasions Watchful Waiter sees her and notes her licence plate.  \n• 11 March – To intimidate the authorities she sets two more fires: one on the roof of Bradley’s Men’s Store, timed so that the fire brigade will be occupied when her second blaze consumes the empty house on Sunnydale Drive.  \n• 12 March – Hoping to learn how much the police know and perhaps to divert suspicion, she writes a letter to the “Ask Martha” column, signing it “Scared Stiff” and describing a non-existent burly male arsonist fleeing through the front door.  \n• 13 March – Watchful Waiter’s information is passed to Inspector Samuels, the licence trace points straight to Pat Grant, and physical searches of her garage and clothing supply the corroborating evidence (kerosene, rags, roof-tar on her shoes).  Confronted with the facts, she confesses.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nWatchful Waiter – His report is independently confirmed by the police inspection of the wall and by the licence-plate trace; he merely witnessed the culprit’s actions.\n\nKeen Observer – He mis-remembered the radio sequence (he thought the house fire came first), proving he was only guessing.  He had no secret knowledge and was miles away in his car.\n\nMinding My Own Business – He exaggerated the extent of the blaze at Hill’s Drug Store; again, no insider knowledge, just an opportunistic attempt to win the reward.\n\nThe store-owners – They lost property and had no conceivable gain from the fires; moreover none matches the woman seen at the drop site.\n\nThus only “Scared Stiff” had knowledge that could have been acquired solely by the arsonist, and all of the evidence converges on her. \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Keen Observer did not know that the residential fire had been set after the commercial fire. If he had been listening to the shortwave police and fire department calls, as he said, he would have heard that. Minding My Own Business described the drug store fire as much more extensive than it actually was, for the fast fire department response and the sprinkler system contained the fire quickly, and there were no “flames billowing forth” from the drug store. Scared Stiff described the arsonist running out the front door.
