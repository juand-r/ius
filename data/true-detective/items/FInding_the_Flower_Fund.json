      "content": "When the phone rang Monday morning, it was the last of Nan Holcomb’s worries. “What now?” she said, lifting her head from her desk. And however reluctant, she picked up the receiver. “Nan, it’s security. Can you have your employee return our Windex, paper towels, broom … and whatever else he took? He was down here all day Friday borrowing the kitchen sink!” “Who are we talking about here?” “I don’t know his name. … The guy with the long hair.” “Yup. OK. No problem,” she snorted, and hung up abruptly. She had more important things on her mind. Focusing again on the flower fund (an important thing), Nan picked up the receiver, and called security back, “I’m going to need access to my group’s phone records on Friday. I’ll also need the first floor security tapes.” The flower fund was kept locked away in the boss’s office. The fund in Nan Holcomb’s work group was not small pocket change — it totaled close to $500. And early Monday morning, Nan realized this money had been taken from her desk drawer. Nan thought she had hidden the cash well enough. After all, she always told her employees that it was locked in a small file cabinet, behind her bookcase. Nan was not happy to announce that the flower fund was missing. This unfortunate discovery ruined her good mood (she had been delighted with her new office, covered in light shades of white and beige. It was much brighter than her old office on floor three.) But what displeased Nan most was the realization that all of her employees were cunning and clever. Finding the flower fund would prove to be difficult. When Nan confronted her employees at their Monday meeting, she was uneasy. “As you know, normally, I keep my office locked, but the move last week disrupted us in more ways than one.” Nan’s group had moved from floor three to floor five, as part of a company wide reorganization. Constant chaos had been the order of the day for over two weeks. Sighing uncomfortably, Nan began the difficult part of the meeting, “The money was in its normal place Friday morning and I noticed it missing shortly before this meeting. Nobody knows about the fund except us, and first floor security does not show that any of you entered the building over the weekend. It had to have been taken by one of you while we were moving Friday afternoon. It had to have been after my office was moved … there was a period of time that I was away, and the door was unlocked.” James was the first to speak. “That’s quite an accusation, boss.” “I’ll be delighted if I’m proven wrong,” Nan replied, dryly. “That’s why we are going to spend as much time as we need to talk about this. James, we’ll begin with you. Where were you and what were you doing Friday afternoon?” James, brushing the hair away from his eyes, replied, “I split time between cleaning out my old cubicle and setting up the new one here.” This surprised Nan, as James was normally the messiest person in the office, with books scattered all over his work area. Linda was next with her explanation. “I was on the phone in a borrowed cubicle most of the afternoon with a client. In fact, the only time I wasn’t on the phone was when I went down to the first floor break room for a cold drink.” Nan turned next to Justin Thorn. Justin had done the group a big favor Friday by moving the copy machine out of its small room. As he did so, the bottled ink cartridge leaked and smeared all over his hands and clothes, ruining his pants and shoes. Justin’s explanation was believable enough: He had spent all afternoon cleaning the mess from the broken ink cartridge. Last to speak was Lincoln Smith. The likable Lincoln admitted to Nan that he had helped move her furniture up from floor three, but with help from building maintenance. At no time was he alone in her office. “Besides,” he said, “I checked to see that the desk drawers were locked because I didn’t want them to slide during the transition.” He mentioned the rest of his afternoon was spent working on his computer, taking phone calls and moving his own stuff. He assured Nan that he left an electronic paper trail to document his afternoon. Nan looked over her group. Already she was thinking about replacing the thief, who would shortly be terminated. Nan looked directly at the guilty team member and said, “Would you like to leave quietly or shall I have security usher you out?”",

But, his old area downstairs is spotless, and plus, his new area is set up and ready to go. It looks like he’s been there for weeks, not just for a day.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Read everyone’s timetable for Friday afternoon and what independent evidence can back it up.\n2.  Identify anything in each account that either conflicts with the outside evidence (security cameras, telephone logs, mess-free new carpet, etc.) or that reveals knowledge no innocent person should possess.  \n3.  Check the physical setting: new office on the 5th floor, light-coloured carpet, Nan’s desk drawers were left unlocked for a short time while the furniture was in transit.  \n4.  Match each suspect’s story to those objective facts:\n\n   • James – seen all day on the 1st floor repeatedly borrowing cleaning gear; security can confirm.  \n   • Linda – phone company log will print every call; security guard saw her in the break room only once.  \n   • Justin – covered in black ink that ruins beige carpet; Nan’s office is spotless.  \n   • Lincoln – helped carry Nan’s furniture; mentions “I checked to see that the desk drawers were locked.”\n\n5.  Notice the critical slip: Nan has *always* told the group the flower fund is kept “in a small file cabinet behind my book-case.” Only a person who actually opened her *desk drawers* would be certain they needed locking (and would discover the cash there).  \n6.  Lincoln therefore had motive (easy $500), unrestricted opportunity (inside the office while the drawers were still unlocked), and betrays knowledge he should not possess (condition of the drawers). No other suspect satisfies all three legs of means, motive, and opportunity.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJames, Linda, Justin Thorn, Lincoln Smith\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLincoln Smith\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nFriday afternoon, while maintenance was wheeling Nan’s desk from the 3rd to the 5th floor, Lincoln Smith accompanied them. While the maintenance man’s attention was on manoeuvring the desk through doorways, Lincoln pulled open the centre drawer to make sure it would not slide. Inside he discovered the thick envelope that Nan had hidden there instead of in the advertised file cabinet. Realising no one else was watching, he slipped the envelope into his pocket, then pushed the drawer shut to make it look “locked.”  \nAfter the furniture was placed, Lincoln casually told the mover he had “checked that the drawers were locked so they wouldn’t slide,” an explanation that sounded helpful and innocent. He spent the rest of the afternoon on his usual computer and telephone work, leaving an electronic trail he believed would clear him. On Monday, when questioned, he repeated that innocent-sounding detail—unaware that it revealed he had opened the very drawers Nan insisted were always kept locked and supposedly empty of cash.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• James: Security tapes place him on the 1st floor borrowing and returning cleaning supplies almost the entire afternoon. He never went near Nan’s new office.  \n• Linda: The PBX log shows an unbroken series of outgoing and incoming calls from the borrowed cubicle. Security corroborates her single brief trip for a drink. No window of time exists for her to have entered Nan’s office.  \n• Justin Thorn: Head-to-toe ink stains from the copier fiasco would have left smudges on Nan’s pristine white/beige furniture and carpet had he entered. The office is spotless, proving he never set foot inside.  \nOnly Lincoln both had the chance and revealed knowledge of the unlocked desk drawers, sealing his guilt.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
