      "content": "When Merv Weiss called me in on the Great Candy Cane Caper, I wasn’t exactly striped with enthusiasm. His sons, the Weiss boys, or the Three Weiss Men as they were other wise known in the neighborhood, had a well-earned reputation for being a cantankerous lot. But their father was an old friend, and I’d shopped at his hardware store for over forty years. So, I put my other cases on hold for a day, while I looked into the theft of Merv’s giant candy cane. “Hello, Ronald,” I said, as I pushed through the front doors of the store. “Uh-huh,” the oldest of Merv’s three sons grumbled in reply. Ronald was manager of the Outdoors department, and presently he was having one heck of a time lifting an elf garden gnome off the floor. His over-ample stomach kept getting in the way, his woefully thin arms trembling with the effort of hefting the cast-concrete weight. “Let me give you a hand with that,” I volunteered. Ronald heaved to his feet and watched as I easily scooped up the fifty-pound elf and deposited him in a nearby wheelbarrow for safe and easy transport. The man grunted something like thanks, and then trundled off in the direction of his department with his cargo. “Don’t tell me my father hired you to ‘investigate’ the disappearance of that stupid candy cane of his?” That was Michael Weiss, youngest of the Three Weiss Men. He came limping up to me with a look as unfriendly as his brother’s. “Yes,” I replied, “I’m-” “What a waste of money!” the man exclaimed, throwing up his hands. “If he’d let me light up the outside of the store like I’d asked, we wouldn’t have this problem.” Michael was in charge of the store’s Electrical department – lights, fixtures and all things conductive wire-related. He was just as tall as Ronald, but much thinner. “You wanted to string some Christmas lights?” I said. He snorted. “I could’ve made this place brighter than the North Star! But Dad insisted on blowing the Christmas promotional budget on a twenty-foot-long candy cane.” “Okay, that’ll be enough, son.” That was my old friend, Merv, emerged from his office to greet me. Michael tossed his hands into the air in another display of exasperation and limped off down an aisle towards his department. “Is his leg still bothering him, Merv?” I asked. “Yes, it hasn’t fully healed since he got tangled up in that spool of wire a month ago and pulled a hamstring.” I glanced out the door, just as Merv’s third son, Frank, drove up and parked at the curb in front of the store. “Frank’s got a new car, I see.” Merv looked that way, and nodded. “Yes, a hybrid. It is environmentally friendly. How he fits all of his family in there, I have no idea.” The father of six managed the store’s Power Tools department. He nodded curtly at his dad and me as he came through the doors, then walked off in the direction of his section of the store. “Let’s go into my office,” Merv said. “I’ve got something to show you.” Merv’s office was little more than a cubbyhole, jammed full of stuff like his store was. A computer monitor sat on a pile of papers on his desk, and he directed my attention to the screen. “This is the surveillance video from last night – when the candy cane was stolen. I only have the one camera at the front of the store.” He shrugged his shoulders. “It’s all I can afford. And besides, this is still a pretty good neighborhood.” We stared at a black and white picture of the dimmed store interior, long after closing time. A huge candy cane was clearly visible at the front of the store, lying on its side, elevated at the curly end, like some giant Christmas bandy stick. “Kids loved it,” Merv said, shrugging again. “I was going to have a drawing for it on Christmas Eve.” Everything appeared calm and quiet in the store, like the night before Xmas. Until, suddenly, a man strode briskly into camera range – a man dressed in a Santa suit, complete with furry cap, black boots, white beard and overstuffed stomach. “Clever disguise,” I commented. “There’s no way to make out his face or true physique in that costume.” Merv nodded, as the not-so-jolly Saint Nick shoved the curly end of the giant cane off its platform and onto the floor. He then picked up the kids’ candy dream by its curl and dragged it off out of the picture. “That’s it?” “That’s it,” Merv said. “Not much to go on, is it?” Brent Pearson stuck his head into the office. “Okay if I order those sinks we were talking about, Merv?” Brent was in charge of the Plumbing department. That, and the fact he was younger and a half-inch shorter than the Three Weiss Men, led them to call him ‘the little plumber boy’. “Sure,” Merv replied. “Great. I’ll drive over and pick them up in my van later today.” “Want a mint?” I said, pulling a roll out of my pocket and offering one to Brent. “No, thanks. I’m diabetic, remember?” “Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.” Brent went about his business and Merv and I walked to the back of the store, out onto the loading dock. “That thieving Claus must have dragged my candy cane out here, loaded it into something big enough to haul a twenty-foot, hundred-pound treat away,” Merv commented. “I’m guessing Father Christmas didn’t come down the chimney. So how’d he get in?” Merv looked down. “That’s the thing. The store was locked up tight, and there is no sign of a forced entry.” I whistled. “So, it is an inside job.” Merv nodded disconsolately. “That’s why I haven’t called in the police. All of my boys and Brent have keys to the store, and individual keys to their own departments. They shutter off their sections of the store at the end of the day and lock them, and then I lock the store itself.” I mulled that over, staring down at the cement-loading platform myself. I noticed something, and kneeled down, ran a wetted fingertip over a thin line of red and white shavings, tasted them. “Sweet.” I stood up and looked at Merv. “Well, old friend, I know who played bad Santa – took, instead of gave. And I know how he got away with the candy cane, too. It wasn’t with the help of eight tiny reindeer.”",

List them here:\n\n<SUSPECTS>\n<names(s) for all suspects here, comma separated>\n</SUSPECTS>\n\nWho is the culprit?  There is only one.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive\n    •  Ronald – couldn’t care less about the promotion; no known motive for wanting the cane.  \n    •  Michael – openly hated the candy-cane idea, but his objection was to the wasted advertising money, not to the cane itself.  \n    •  Frank – has six children.  A 20-foot lump of solid candy would be a heroic supply of sweets (or could be sold off in chunks).  Perfect Christmas-time motive.  \n    •  Brent – is diabetic; a mountain of sugar is the last thing he needs or wants.\n\n2.  Opportunity\n    All four men possess store keys, so each could have entered after closing.  We therefore look for narrowing clues.\n\n3.  Physical evidence / clues\n    •  Security tape shows “Santa” WALKING briskly – no limp at all.  Michael, still nursing a torn hamstring, is ruled out.\n    •  Ronald can barely lift a 50-lb concrete gnome.  Dragging 100 lb of candy around the store and up onto a loading dock is beyond him.\n    •  Fine red-and-white shavings on the loading dock prove the cane was sawed into smaller pieces.\n    •  Of the four, only Frank, the Power-Tools manager, would both (a) have immediate, after-hours access to a suitable power saw and (b) be comfortable using it quickly and quietly.\n    •  Vehicle size: Brent has a roomy van that could have carried the cane whole—no need to saw it up.  Frank, however, drives a small hybrid; he would HAVE to cut the cane into pieces first.  The shavings therefore point straight at him.\n\n4.  Logical elimination\n    •  No-limp Santa ⇒ not Michael  \n    •  Heavy drag job ⇒ not Ronald  \n    •  Has to want sugar and need to saw it ⇒ not Brent  \n    •  The only remaining candidate, who also fits every mechanical clue, is Frank.\n\nHence Frank Weiss is the thief.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRonald Weiss, Michael Weiss, Frank Weiss, Brent Pearson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nFrank Weiss\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate last night Frank Weiss returned to the locked store using his own key.  \nHe donned a Santa suit stuffed with padding so the camera would not reveal his build.  \nEntering through the front, he tipped the 20-foot candy cane off its display and, holding it by the curled end, dragged it down the main aisle to the rear loading dock.  \nOut on the dock he plugged in one of the store’s portable power saws from his own department and sliced the cane into several two- to three-foot lengths, leaving a sprinkling of peppermint-red shavings on the concrete.  \nHe stacked the sections inside his small hybrid car, locked the store behind him, and drove home—ready to delight (or over-sugar) his six children for the holidays.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Ronald Weiss – Lacks the physical strength.  His difficulty lifting a 50-lb gnome shows he could not man-handle a 100-lb candy cane across the store and up a dock ramp.  \n•  Michael Weiss – Still limps badly from his hamstring injury; the man on the tape walks normally.  \n•  Brent Pearson – Could handle the weight, but the job was needlessly messy for someone with a van big enough to carry the cane intact.  More telling, a diabetic has no use for a mountain of sugar, giving him neither motive nor benefit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

How?” Merv asked, astonished that I could wrap up the case so quickly.\n“Your son, Frank,” I stated bluntly. “As the man with the power tools, he simply power-sawed the giant candy cane into manageable pieces and then stacked them in his car and drove away. There’re still a few shavings around that he missed in his clean-up.”\n“But any one of the four could have done that, couldn’t they? How do you know for sure it was Frank?”\n“Simple. The man on the surveillance tape walked into camera range; he didn’t limp. That lets Michael off the hook. And there’s no way Ronald could’ve dragged that heavy candy cane around like the man in the video. He just doesn’t have the strength. So, he’s innocent. And Brent Pearson is diabetic. He’s got about as much use for a hundred pounds of cane sugar as Santa has for another plate of cookies.”\nMerv nodded, convinced. “But why did Frank do it?”\nIt was my turn to shrug. “I guess six kids can put an awful strain on a family’s candy budget this time of year.”"
