      "content": "The library lecturer, Matthew O’Leary, was enjoying himself. He was a good, informal speaker, full of funny anecdotes about famous people, and his audience, from the Ronald Reagan Junior High School, hung on every word. His topic was Presidential Summit Meetings, and since Mr. O’Leary had personally been on a number of these trips, he could tell what really went on behind the scenes. And he did. “My favorite summit was the one in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1985,” O’Leary said. “You should be interested in that one, because President Ronald Reagan, for whom your school is named, took part. He was meeting the Soviet leader, Gorbachev, and they were talking about nuclear arms. It was a tense time, until the goldfish incident. Then it got even more tense! We realized after all that we’d come to Geneva thinking our toughest job would be to handle the Russians. We soon found out it wasn’t, not by a long shot. His audience leaned forward, anxious to hear all the details. “You see,” O’Leary went on, “the President was staying at a fine residence outside Geneva. It belonged to Prince Karim Aga Khan. The Prince, his wife and their three children, Zahra and her brothers Rahim and Hussein, had moved out so that the President and his staff, including me, could use the house. It was very nice of them. Apparently Prince Karim had been educated in the United States and had warm feelings still for our country. “It turned out that the only condition for the stay was in a note to President Reagan from Prince Hussein, the youngest, who was ten years old. He wanted to be sure that his goldfish were fed every day. That’s why he wrote his letter to the President, to be sure. They were in a special goldfish tank in Hussein’s bedroom on the second floor. Nobody used the bedroom, but we remembered to feed the goldfish. “If we forgot, it was because we were all so very busy. I worked for the Office of Security, and my job was to make sure that the President was safe. Nothing else mattered or was allowed to distract me. “There was plenty to do. As a matter of routine, we checked out any threats against the President and made sure that nobody unauthorized went in or out of rooms, including the living areas at the residence the President was using. There were motor convoys back and forth to the Embassy and to the reception hall provided by the Swiss Government for the negotiations themselves. Of course, there were also receptions at the Russian Embassy and at ours, which involved a lot of checking back and forth, to make sure that only authorized people were there, in each meeting and for each event. “We did our job well, I think. But our job was just the background. The really serious stuff was what the President and Mikhail Gorbachev were talking about, nuclear weapons and our security. The press, of course, never gave anybody a moment’s rest, but Ronald Reagan had a winning way about him and usually got very good press. “Of course, people who write the briefing papers and delivered the diplomatic cables were kept busy, and that’s putting it mildly! George Adams from the Embassy, who was assigned to the delegation to make sure that everything was done that could be done to insure a successful summit, said when we left, that he hadn’t seen his family in waking hours for a week! But, of course, the President was busiest of all. “What happened at the Geneva Summit? The leaders got to know each other, Reagan and Gorbachev. They could build on that in later meetings, I think. There wasn’t any agreement on nuclear matters reached at Geneva, but I don’t really think that an agreement was expected then. It was just too soon. Besides, I like to take a long view. There was an agreement reached between the United States and the Russians a few years later, and I think the earlier meetings we had in Geneva in 1985 helped make that possible. “That’s when I found out about the goldfish drama. “The morning we left, our host’s wife, the Princess Salima, who was actually English by origin, returned with her three children. They had just come in, and were taking off their coats, while Princess Salima gave instructions for the staff to take their bags upstairs. I happened to be passing through the downstairs reception room when the housekeeper, Ermina Glandon, came up to Princess Salima. She was really pretty upset.” He paused for a drink of water. “So, what happened?” An impatient boy in the front row wanted to know. “Where was I? Oh, yes. Ermina Glandon told the Princess that she had started early, as soon as the rooms were vacated by the American guests, because she wasn’t sure what condition the residence would be in. She had been cleaning the rooms one by one, and had just discovered something wrong in Hussein’s bedroom. It was the goldfish tank. There were too many goldfish! There had been six when the family had left, and now there were seven. That was just the sort of trick that Rahim liked to play on his younger brother. Also, two of the goldfish didn’t look anything like the other five, and the six fish that were all supposed to be there had been so much alike that nobody could tell them apart. Hussein would have a fit when he saw the goldfish, she said.” “Sounds like something a mean big brother would do,” said a girl in the second row. “Well maybe,” O’Leary conceded. “I will tell you this much. George Adams from our Embassy here saw there was a storm brewing, and he went up to Princess Salima, introduced himself, and handed her a letter with a Presidential seal. Adams lived in Geneva, and knew everything about the city. He was a real help, and he lived and died for just a successful Summit meeting, he told me, so that he could then take off on a long delayed skiing vacation in the Alps. I never saw anything interfere with the way he handled paperwork - he seemed unaware of anything else. But you never know.” “Aren’t you going to tell us what happened?” Several members of his audience said at once that they wanted to know the answer to this riddle. “How many goldfish were there? And if some were replaced, who did it?” “You people can decide that,” O’Leary said. And when you’ve done that, I’ll tell you how the Geneva Goldfish Summit Mystery was actually solved!”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What has to be explained?\n   • Six identical goldfish were originally in Hussein’s tank.\n   • On the morning the Americans left there were seven fish and two did not match the other five.\n\n2. Who could have put the extra (and different) fish in the aquarium?\n   • It had to be someone who was in the house before the Aga Khan family returned and who had physical access to Hussein’s bedroom.\n   • It had to be someone who cared enough about the fish to bother replacing one that had died.\n\n3. Checking each principal character:\n   • Matthew O’Leary – states flatly that his security work allowed “nothing else to distract me.”\n   • George Adams – buried in paperwork, living for his ski-vacation, seen only handling documents; his first appearance in the story is delivering a sealed presidential letter after the discovery.\n   • Rahim – arrived with the family; had no prior access.\n   • Ermina Glandon – discovers the odd fish the very moment rooms are free; had no earlier opportunity.\n   • President Reagan – was in the residence every night, had promised the ten-year-old Hussein that the fish would be fed, and therefore had both motive (not to disappoint a child) and opportunity (he could go anywhere in the house at any hour).\n\n4. Positive Evidence\n   • A letter on presidential stationery, handed over by Adams, in which President Reagan himself explains that he found one fish dead “on Tuesday” and “added two new ones.”\n   • The letter accounts precisely for the observed facts: one original fish died (explaining the appearance of different fish) and the President, to be doubly certain the number was still six, over-compensated by buying two, producing seven.\n\n5. Logical ded​uction\n   • The only person both willing and able to act, and who actually confesses in writing, is Ronald Reagan.  No one else had the combination of motive, opportunity, and evidence.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPresident Ronald Reagan, Matthew O’Leary, George Adams, Rahim Aga Khan, Ermina Glandon, Princess Salima, Zahra Aga Khan\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nPresident Ronald Reagan\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Sunday night: Six identical goldfish are alive in Hussein’s bedroom aquarium.  \n• Early Tuesday: President Reagan, doing a quick inspection before leaving for the day’s meetings, notices one fish floating dead.  Remembering the ten-year-old’s note and not wanting to disappoint him, the President orders a staff aide to obtain “two of the same kind” immediately—better to have one too many than one too few.  \n• A little later Tuesday: The aide purchases two goldfish, but they are not the exact variety; nevertheless, they are placed in the tank.  The President pens a short apology/explanation on White-House stationery, seals it, and leaves it with other outgoing papers.  \n• Departure morning (Friday): As soon as the American delegation vacates, housekeeper Ermina Glandon begins cleaning.  She discovers seven fish, two visibly different.  \n• The Aga Khan family walks in while the commotion is going on.  \n• George Adams, collecting all last-minute documents, sees the sealed presidential note, realises it concerns the fish dispute, and hands it to Princess Salima, thereby solving the “mystery.”\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Matthew O’Leary – Preoccupied round-the-clock with presidential security; no need or time to visit a child’s bedroom or buy fish.  \n• George Adams – His only role was ferrying paperwork; the letter he delivered actually exonerates him and points to the true actor.  \n• Rahim Aga Khan – Arrived only moments before the discovery; had zero prior access to the house.  \n• Ermina Glandon – First to raise the alarm; clearly surprised by what she saw.  \n• Princess Salima & Zahra – Were away with the rest of the family until the house was vacated; therefore had no opportunity.  \nThe only person left, confirmed by his own signed note, is President Ronald Reagan.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Rahim, who had just arrived with his mother, brother and sister, had no time to change the goldfish. Neither did the housekeeper, Ermina Glandon, who made the discovery that very day.\nThat left President Reagan, who was upset when he found one of the goldfish that Hussein had left to his care, had died. He made it a priority to find and replace the fish, and he left this letter for the family. It read: “Dear Friends, On Tuesday I found one of your fish dead in the bottom of the tank. I don’t know what happened but I added two new ones, same kind. I hope this was all right. Thanks for letting us live in your lovely home. Ronald Reagan”"
