      "content": "\"Eddie's missing.\" \"How is that even possible? He weighs 240 pounds!\" The classroom laughed at Reggie's joke, but I was worried. Eddie Cavanaugh was the high school's star quarterback. Each week his expert passing led the football team to victory, and no other school in the state had ever won this many games in a row. \"People say jocks are stupid, but Eddie isn't,\" sighed our history teacher. \"He was making our little town famous, and now he's gone.\" Eddie's mother had called the principal's office about one o’clock when she noticed Eddie was missing, and soon everyone in the school was talking about the news. He'd come to school that morning, but then somehow, he'd vanished! As the last school bell rang, I asked Reggie if he wanted to search for Eddie. \"Sure, why not?\" Reggie laughed. \"If we find our missing quarterback, then WE can be the school's heroes.\" But where could we find some clues? The locker room was a good place to start. As we approached, we heard the team shouting enthusiastically \"One! Two! Three! Go!\" as they shuffled out onto the field. Tomorrow they would play an away game in Capitol City - a two-hour drive - so they were getting some extra practice today. We smelled grass and sweaty uniforms, but then we spotted Mr. Roster, the assistant coach, talking on his cellphone. \"Eddie's mother just called me,\" he was saying with exasperation. \"Look, we're doing everything we can.\" His brow furrowed in anger. \"No, we're not canceling the game...\" We waited until the call was done, then asked about Eddie's disappearance. \"You don't realize how important someone is, until they're not around!\" Mr. Roster sighed. \"The team knows it, too. Eddie always led an inspiring cheer after school before each practice. We miss him already.\" Can we search his locker? Reggie asked. The coach looked at us suspiciously, but realized we were trying to help. He led us into his office, where he retrieved a clipboard with all the lockers' combinations. Inside Eddie's we saw his jersey - number 17 - dangling from a hanger. There was nothing unusual in the locker. There were his cleats, his helmet, shoulder pads, kneepads and a sack lunch. But on the door of the locker, we found Eddie's secret motivational tool. He'd drawn a graph for himself, showing various records for high school football. First it showed the school's record for consecutive wins and then the state's and then the record for the entire country. As Coach Roster ran after two players who were arguing, I motioned to Reggie. Coach Roster's office door was open, and we snuck in to search for clues. Reggie opened a filing cabinet and saw manila folders in alphabetical order. He quickly looked for the C's, while I started searching Coach Roster's desk. Its top was filled by a giant desk calendar. I checked yesterday's date, which just said \"Practice,\" like every other day this week. But today's date had an unusual entry, \"Visit Dr. Lazlow, 9 to 11a.m. Capitol City.\" Reggie retrieved a file labeled \"Cavanaugh, Eddie.\" There was a handwritten note. \"Eddie, stop playing, or you'll get hurt, Mae\" it warned. \"What are you doing!\" shouted a voice behind us. Coach Roster had returned and caught Reggie and me by surprise. \"We were looking for clues about Eddie,\" I answered nervously. \"Well, you might as well know,\" sighed Coach Roster wearily. \"That note turned up on the locker room door yesterday. I should've taken it more seriously - but who the heck is 'Mae'?\" Reggie had an idea. \"Eddie's girlfriend is named Marissa! I bet Mae is her nickname.\" Now we had a trail to follow - but where was Marissa? If she was missing too, it might explain Eddie's disappearance. Marissa wasn't a cheerleader, just a hard-working student from a very poor family. Reggie found her family's listing in the phone book, and soon we were traveling to her address. It was a small apartment in a large complex. Marissa's father answered the door, then called out \"Marissa, are you here?\" \"Go away!\" shouted a voice inside. \"Marissa, get out here!\" her father yelled. We waited anxiously, until a bedroom door opened, and we saw our unhappy classmate. Her hair was messy, and her make-up was smeared. It was obvious that she'd been crying. \"What do you want?\" she asked us. We're looking for Eddie, I told her. \"So's half the town,\" she said bitterly. \"Everyone loved Eddie.\" We agreed and couldn't help talking about his popularity. \"It's so unfair,\" Marissa complained. \"Eddie was always so alone. He didn't have a father or even a brother or sister. There is just his mother. And yet this town became his family. He'd made everyone so proud.\" Reggie and I nodded, but Marissa continued, her thoughts far away. \"Eddie said that more than anything he just wanted to get engaged to me some day and settle down as a hero in this very same town. But now he's gone.\" \"Maybe he'll send a message to you, Mae,\" Reggie said, nonchalantly. \"Who's Mae?\" she asked, with irritation. We were running out of clues, but decided to visit Eddie's mother. Her house was a few blocks from Marissa's, and we hoped she wasn't upset when we rang her doorbell. Mrs. Cavanaugh was glad to see friends of Eddie's and quickly invited us in. \"I always worried Eddie would hurt himself,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said. \"All the phone calls I've gotten show what Eddie meant to this town. But I just want my darling boy back.\" Her wall was filled with pictures of Eddie, some in his football uniform, others showing him as a young boy. I asked her when she'd first noticed Eddie was missing. \"I always make him a healthy lunch,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh sighed. \"I leave it on the kitchen counter, since I have to leave for work ten minutes before Eddie leaves for school.\" \"But this afternoon when I came home from work - his sack lunch was still there!\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said with exasperation. \"That's when I realized that Eddie was missing.\" \"We're looking for him,\" Reggie assured her. \"I'm glad to know his friends care about him,\" she smiled. She talked about Marissa and her hopes for her son. \"Come back and visit any time.\" On the sidewalk, Reggie was upset. \"I don't know who could've done this,\" he complained. \"Everyone loved Eddie. In fact, maybe Eddie faked the whole thing himself,\" Reggie said, more serious than I'd ever seen him. \"Being the star quarterback wasn't enough for him. He wanted everyone to worry about him too.\" \"I'm not worried,\" I said, \"because I know where Eddie is. And if you study the clues, you'll know too.",

He weighs 240 pounds!\" The classroom laughed at Reggie's joke, but I was worried. Eddie Cavanaugh was the high school's star quarterback. Each week his expert passing led the football team to victory, and no other school in the state had ever won this many games in a row. \"People say jocks are stupid, but Eddie isn't,\" sighed our history teacher. \"He was making our little town famous, and now he's gone.\" Eddie's mother had called the principal's office about one o’clock when she noticed Eddie was missing, and soon everyone in the school was talking about the news.

As the last school bell rang, I asked Reggie if he wanted to search for Eddie. \"Sure, why not?\" Reggie laughed. \"If we find our missing quarterback, then WE can be the school's heroes.\" But where could we find some clues? The locker room was a good place to start. As we approached, we heard the team shouting enthusiastically \"One! Two! Three! Go!\" as they shuffled out onto the field. Tomorrow they would play an away game in Capitol City - a two-hour drive - so they were getting some extra practice today. We smelled grass and sweaty uniforms, but then we spotted Mr. Roster, the assistant coach, talking on his cellphone. \"Eddie's mother just called me,\" he was saying with exasperation. \"Look, we're doing everything we can.\" His brow furrowed in anger. \"No, we're not canceling the game...\" We waited until the call was done, then asked about Eddie's disappearance. \"You don't realize how important someone is, until they're not around!\" Mr. Roster sighed. \"The team knows it, too. Eddie always led an inspiring cheer after school before each practice. We miss him already.\" Can we search his locker? Reggie asked. The coach looked at us suspiciously, but realized we were trying to help. He led us into his office, where he retrieved a clipboard with all the lockers' combinations. Inside Eddie's we saw his jersey - number 17 - dangling from a hanger. There was nothing unusual in the locker. There were his cleats, his helmet, shoulder pads, kneepads and a sack lunch. But on the door of the locker, we found Eddie's secret motivational tool. He'd drawn a graph for himself, showing various records for high school football. First it showed the school's record for consecutive wins and then the state's and then the record for the entire country. As Coach Roster ran after two players who were arguing, I motioned to Reggie. Coach Roster's office door was open, and we snuck in to search for clues. Reggie opened a filing cabinet and saw manila folders in alphabetical order. He quickly looked for the C's, while I started searching Coach Roster's desk. Its top was filled by a giant desk calendar. I checked yesterday's date, which just said \"Practice,\" like every other day this week. But today's date had an unusual entry, \"Visit Dr. Lazlow, 9 to 11a.m. Capitol City.\" Reggie retrieved a file labeled \"Cavanaugh, Eddie.\" There was a handwritten note. \"Eddie, stop playing, or you'll get hurt, Mae\" it warned. \"What are you doing!\" shouted a voice behind us. Coach Roster had returned and caught Reggie and me by surprise. \"We were looking for clues about Eddie,\" I answered nervously. \"Well, you might as well know,\" sighed Coach Roster wearily. \"That note turned up on the locker room door yesterday. I should've taken it more seriously - but who the heck is 'Mae'?\" Reggie had an idea. \"Eddie's girlfriend is named Marissa! I bet Mae is her nickname.\" Now we had a trail to follow - but where was Marissa? If she was missing too, it might explain Eddie's disappearance. Marissa wasn't a cheerleader, just a hard-working student from a very poor family. Reggie found her family's listing in the phone book, and soon we were traveling to her address. It was a small apartment in a large complex. Marissa's father answered the door, then called out \"Marissa, are you here?\" \"Go away!\" shouted a voice inside. \"Marissa, get out here!\" her father yelled. We waited anxiously, until a bedroom door opened, and we saw our unhappy classmate. Her hair was messy, and her make-up was smeared. It was obvious that she'd been crying. \"What do you want?\" she asked us. We're looking for Eddie, I told her. \"So's half the town,\" she said bitterly. \"Everyone loved Eddie.\" We agreed and couldn't help talking about his popularity. \"It's so unfair,\" Marissa complained. \"Eddie was always so alone. He didn't have a father or even a brother or sister. There is just his mother. And yet this town became his family.

But now he's gone.\" \"Maybe he'll send a message to you, Mae,\" Reggie said, nonchalantly. \"Who's Mae?\" she asked, with irritation. We were running out of clues, but decided to visit Eddie's mother. Her house was a few blocks from Marissa's, and we hoped she wasn't upset when we rang her doorbell. Mrs. Cavanaugh was glad to see friends of Eddie's and quickly invited us in. \"I always worried Eddie would hurt himself,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said. \"All the phone calls I've gotten show what Eddie meant to this town. But I just want my darling boy back.\" Her wall was filled with pictures of Eddie, some in his football uniform, others showing him as a young boy. I asked her when she'd first noticed Eddie was missing. \"I always make him a healthy lunch,\" Mrs. Cavanaugh sighed. \"I leave it on the kitchen counter, since I have to leave for work ten minutes before Eddie leaves for school.\" \"But this afternoon when I came home from work - his sack lunch was still there!\" Mrs. Cavanaugh said with exasperation. \"That's when I realized that Eddie was missing.\" \"We're looking for him,\" Reggie assured her. \"I'm glad to know his friends care about him,\" she smiled. She talked about Marissa and her hopes for her son. \"Come back and visit any time.\" On the sidewalk, Reggie was upset. \"I don't know who could've done this,\" he complained. \"Everyone loved Eddie. In fact, maybe Eddie faked the whole thing himself,\" Reggie said, more serious than I'd ever seen him. \"Being the star quarterback wasn't enough for him. He wanted everyone to worry about him too.\" \"I'm not worried,\" I said, \"because I know where Eddie is. And if you study the clues, you'll know too.\n\"Eddie wouldn't fake his own disappearance,\" I assured Reggie. \"Remember that graph in his locker? Even in private, Eddie proudly tracked the records he was breaking.\"\nReggie thought for a moment. \"And we saw his attendance chart in Coach Roster's office. He'd never even missed a practice before.\"\n\"Coach Roster seemed like a likely suspect,\" I pointed out. \"But he'd had a 9 a.m. appointment in Capitol City this morning. That's two hours away! He couldn't drive there, drive back, and then somehow kidnap Eddie before he'd left for school.\"\n\"But someone left that note on the locker room door!\"\n\"And it wasn't Marissa,\" I said. \"She seemed genuinely upset at Eddie's disappearance. And it's obvious no one ever called her 'Mae' before.\"\n\"But then who's Mae?\" Reggie asked.\n\"Come on,\" I told Reggie, leading him back to Mrs. Cavanaugh's house.\n\"Is your name Mae?\" Reggie blurted out as soon as she answered the door.\n\"Why yes,\" she said, smiling graciously.\n\"We saw Eddie's sack lunch in his locker,\" I said. \"So it's obvious he didn't leave it on your counter this morning.\"\nMrs. Cavanaugh stared back at us silently, then said \"You're right. I was telling you a lie. I called Eddie's cellphone when he got to school, and asked him to hurry back home. I just love my son so much. And football is such a dangerous sport. I guess I just wanted to protect him.\"\nWe heard a loud noise in the basement. Running down the stairs, we heard a loud banging coming from behind a locked door. We unlocked the door, and opened it up. And standing inside...was Eddie!\n\"Ma locked me in the TV room this morning!\" Eddie said with a grin. \"I'm sure glad to see you guys!\" Eddie kissed his mother on the cheek, and then headed off to school for the end of practice.\nThe next day the team would win their big game against Capitol City, and continue their record-breaking streak.\nBut the next day for our detective work, we were heroes too.\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the time line  \n   • 7:30 a.m. (≈) Mrs. Cavanaugh (called “Mae” on the note) leaves for work, putting Eddie’s lunch on the kitchen counter.  \n   • 7:40 a.m. Eddie normally leaves for school.  \n   • 7:45 a.m. (≈) Mae telephones Eddie on his cell just as he reaches school and tells him to “come straight home.”  \n   • 1:00 p.m. Mae phones the principal to report Eddie “missing.”\n\n2. Examine MOTIVE  \n   • Mrs. Cavanaugh—openly worries football is dangerous and “just wants her darling boy back.” She is the only one with a clear protective motive.  \n   • Coach Roster—needs Eddie to play; the note threatens exactly what he does not want. No motive to remove Eddie.  \n   • Marissa—adores Eddie and wants to marry him “some day”; no motive.  \n   • Reggie / narrator—merely classmates who admire Eddie.\n\n3. Check OPPORTUNITY & ALIBI  \n   • Coach Roster’s desk calendar shows a 9-11 a.m. appointment in Capitol City, two hours away. He could not be in town at the critical morning period.  \n   • Marissa was home in tears when the detectives arrive; no indication she ever left school to abduct a 240-lb quarterback.  \n   • Only Mrs. Cavanaugh was certainly at the house and in private telephone contact with Eddie at the right time.\n\n4. PHYSICAL / DIRECT CLUES  \n   • Eddie’s “sack lunch” is in his locker—proof he reached school.  \n   • Mae claims that same lunch was still on her counter—an outright contradiction proving she is lying.  \n   • Threat note signed “Mae.” Nobody except Eddie’s mother is called Mae. Marissa doesn’t even recognize the name.  \n   • Loud banging in the locked basement and Mae’s immediate confession once confronted.\n\n5. Logical DEDUCTION  \n   The single person with motive (maternal protectiveness), opportunity (at home, phoned Eddie back), the initials on the threat note, and the false story about the uneaten lunch is Mae Cavanaugh. Therefore she locked Eddie in the basement herself to stop him from playing, then staged a “missing” call so the Friday game would be cancelled.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMae Cavanaugh, Coach Roster, Marissa (girlfriend), Reggie, Narrator\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMae “Mrs. Mae Cavanaugh” (Eddie’s mother)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nKnowing Eddie would not willingly quit the team, Mae Cavanaugh decided to keep him from playing the next day’s game.  \n1. She left for work as usual but quickly returned home.  \n2. After Eddie reached school, she phoned him, begging him to come right back because of an “emergency.”  \n3. When Eddie arrived, she coaxed him into the basement TV room, locked the door, and removed the key.  \n4. She then wrote a threatening note—“Eddie, stop playing, or you’ll get hurt, ‑-Mae”—and taped it to the locker-room door to make the disappearance look sinister.  \n5. At 1 p.m. she called the school, pretending surprise that Eddie was missing, hoping the football program would cancel practice and the game for safety reasons.  \n6. Her plan unraveled when classmates noticed the contradiction about the sack lunch and recognized the name “Mae” on the note.  \n7. Confronted, Mae confessed; Eddie was freed from the locked basement room and rejoined practice in time for the big game.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Coach Roster: Documented 9-11 a.m. appointment two hours away eliminates any chance to lure Eddie back home. He desperately wants Eddie to play, the opposite of the kidnapper’s goal.  \n• Marissa: Has no nickname “Mae,” was genuinely distraught, and lacked both means and motive to imprison her own boyfriend.  \n• Reggie & Narrator: Investigators only; no motive to stop Eddie from playing and were together the entire afternoon, unable to have hidden Eddie.  \nThus all evidence consistently points only to Mae Cavanaugh.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
