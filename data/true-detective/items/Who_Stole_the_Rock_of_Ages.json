      "content": "The Deer Valley Rock Art Center is a repository of art and history, preserving ancient petroglyphs and pictographs for the modern world to study and enjoy. Maintained as a part of Arizona State University, it is ideally situated near caches of desert rock, upon which natives could leave their mark in the clay-coated surfaces. The meaning of this art will forever be uncertain, as the artists died long before any art critics had the chance to ask. Since the artists are long gone, their work is priceless, valuable beyond any dollar measure. Sadly, such value can lead to problems as well. Dr. Welsh could barely contain himself. First, someone had delivered, practically to his doorstep, the most astounding piece of art ever, and now, not a week later, it had been stolen. It was intolerable. How could anyone stoop so low as to steal this prize of humanity, this “Stona Lisa” of petroglyphs? Only money could drive a person to act so fiendishly, he reasoned. Disgusted, he shook his head and waited. Sure enough, his four research students showed up for their Monday morning assignments, right on time. Three of them made it on time, anyway. Denise showed up five minutes late, her leg in a cast. Dr. Welsh was too preoccupied to notice, so she didn’t get the usual lecture on punctuality. Dr. Welsh knew that one of these four was the culprit. His other staff all had perfect alibis, and the evidence pointed clearly to an inside job. The alarm had been deactivated Sunday, at 11:03 a.m., and reactivated just three minutes later. The thief had known the codes and known exactly where to find their prize quickly – back in the preservation lab. So far, no one had informed the students of the theft. He decided to keep it that way, for the moment. Only the thief would know. Aside from the time of the theft, Dr. Welsh had only one other clue to work with. A trail of sand had fallen from the thief’s pants or shoes as he or she walked through the building. In Arizona, such a thing wouldn’t be unusual, but a quick lab test had shown that the sand didn’t match the local sand – it had a different composition, and came from somewhere else. The students had just had a three-day weekend, so the culprit had probably gotten sandy while on vacation somewhere. It was time to begin. Dr. Welsh took a deep breath to compose himself, and went to greet his students. “Welcome back everyone. I trust you all had a relaxing weekend.” Skye Smith piped up immediately. “It was good, but not as nice as being here.” Juan Carde snorted at her. “Are you kidding? Anything is more relaxing than work.” When Dr. Welsh raised an eyebrow, Juan hurried to adjust his wording. “But working here is still better than other places, I mean.” “Oh, would you two stop sucking up so we can get our assignments?” Denise wasn’t in the mood to be patient. “I want to go sit down already.” Denise was usually such a sweet girl that she caught Dr. Welsh’s attention. “My apologies Denise, I hadn’t noticed your leg before now.” He waved them all into the lobby, where chairs were plentiful. “There’s no rush to get to work on a Monday, but we can certainly talk sitting down.” Once they were seated, Dr. Welsh knew what he wanted to ask everyone, and had the perfect place to start. “However did you manage to break your leg this weekend?” Denise grimaced, either in pain or embarrassment; it was difficult to tell which. “I thought it would be a good idea to hit the slopes up in Aspen, Colorado. About the time I tumbled down the mountainside Saturday morning, I started to rethink that idea.” Dr. Welsh needed a little more information. “How did you manage to get home with that leg?” “After they had me patched up, they contacted my parents for me. They came and drove me home after I was released from the hospital Sunday afternoon. They said that next year I should just take them along so that they could enjoy the skiing part too. That’s sympathy for you.” Dr. Welsh nodded thoughtfully. “What about you Mr. Gaigon? You’ve been awfully quiet this morning.” Jim quickly looked up from the floor. (Had he been avoiding Dr. Welsh’s eyes, or sneaking a nap?) “I’m sorry professor; I didn’t – YAWN – sleep much last night. I spent the weekend in Roswell, New Mexico, visiting the International UFO Museum and Research Center. I came back late yesterday afternoon, but I tell you, that desert sun coming west was murder on my eyes. I kept dreaming about bright spots and aliens all night long. It was creepy.” Juan scoffed at his story. “UFO’s, ha! You think the sun was bad on your drive? Coming back from Long Beach, California yesterday afternoon was just as bright, and I hate driving into the sun. Oh, but a weekend in the surf was well worth it.” Dr. Welsh looked surprised. “Why Juan, I didn’t know you were a surfer.” Now it was Juan’s turn to look a bit embarrassed. “Well, I’m not much of one yet, I’m still learning. When I say I spent my time in the surf, I mean exactly that. I kept falling off my board. I think the people were calling me ‘Can’t-Stay-On Juan’ by the time I left.” That got a chuckle out of Dr. Welsh, despite his usually professional demeanor, and despite all that was on his mind. “We’ll promise to let you be just plain Juan here, never fear. What about you Skye, how was your vacation? You look a bit tanned.” “And well I should,” answered Skye, flipping back her long brown hair. I flew down to Cozumel, Mexico for some scuba diving with the fishes. I’ll bet you didn’t know that I scuba either.” “Well actually...” began Dr. Welsh, but Skye went on after inhaling. “It was beautiful, just like always, with the sparkling water and the beautiful fish, and so much to see, and the perfect sun for tanning. Oh, I could have stayed forever, except that I would never do that to you. Even so, I almost didn’t make it back. My plane was delayed, and delayed again, and it didn’t get back here until one this morning. But I’m still not as sleepy as Jim. I slept on the plane. I always say – get your sleep when there’s nothing to do, or else you’ll miss it when there is.” She glared over at her snoozing colleague. “Okay Jim, you can wake up now, I’m done.” Jim yawned and stretched. “I feel much better now,” he managed. “That’s good Jim,” began Dr. Welsh, “because I have some important news for you all.” They all perked up, attentive to what he would say. “Yesterday morning, someone stole the ‘Stona Lisa’ we received last week.” Four gasps caused him to pause. “Worse, the theft was by one of our own – one of you four, and I’m afraid that I now know who that person is. You all have alibis, but the guilty person is lying. Please don’t do anything silly, a police officer is patiently waiting in the next room.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Time of the crime  \n   • Alarm off 11:03 a.m. – on again 11:06 a.m. Sunday.  \n   • Thief therefore had to be in Phoenix late Sunday morning.\n\n2. Only clue left behind  \n   • Trail of non-local sand.  Beach or dune sand that does **not** match Arizona desert soil.\n\n3. Each student’s story checked against (a) location 11 a.m. Sunday and (b) likelihood of carrying foreign sand.  \n\n   a) Denise (skiing, broken leg)  \n      – Hospitalised in Aspen, CO till Sunday afternoon.  \n      – Impossible to be in Phoenix 11 a.m.; mountain snow ≠ beach sand.  \n   \n   b) Skye (scuba in Cozumel)  \n      – Plane landed 1 a.m. Monday.  \n      – Still in Mexico 11 a.m. Sunday.  Coral sand could match clue, but timing rules her out.  \n  \n   c) Jim (Roswell, NM)  \n      – Driving WEST toward Phoenix Sunday afternoon; sun in eyes is plausible (sun sets in west).  \n      – Desert soil around Roswell similar to Arizona’s, not the odd beach-type sand.  \n      – Still on highway 11 a.m.\n\n   d) Juan (Long Beach, CA)  \n      – Says he drove home “yesterday afternoon” and “the sun was bright in my eyes.”  \n      – Driving EAST from California puts the rising sun in your eyes in the MORNING, not afternoon.  \n      – Therefore he lied about the time of his return and was already in Phoenix by late morning.  \n      – Surfing explains alien sand – beach sand from Long Beach—exactly the alien composition found.  \n      – Lied ⇒ felt need to hide presence in town at the crucial time ⇒ thief.\n\n4. Motive  \n   • Petroglyph nick-named the “Stona Lisa” is priceless; easy to fence to private collector.  \n   • Juan already admits he is learning to surf – an expensive hobby – hint at need for money.\n\nLogical conclusion: Juan is the only one who (a) could physically be at the Center at 11 a.m., (b) would be carrying foreign sand, and (c) lied to fabricate an alibi.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDenise (last name unspecified), Skye Smith, Jim Gaigon, Juan Carde\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJuan Carde\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Early Sunday, long before sunrise, Juan loads his car in Long Beach. Sand from the beach is still in his shoes and cuffs.  \n• He heads east on I-10.  Driving east at dawn, the low morning sun blinds him; that detail sticks in his mind.  \n• By about 10:45 a.m. he reaches the Deer Valley Rock Art Center.  As a student employee he knows the security code and the exact cabinet where the newly arrived “Stona Lisa” is being temporarily stored in the preservation lab.  \n• 11:03 a.m. – He taps in the code, silences the alarm, goes straight to the cabinet, removes the plaque and conceals it in a pre-lined duffel bag.  \n• 11:06 a.m. – Alarm reset, he walks out, leaving a faint track of Long Beach sand through the corridor and parking lot.  \n• He drives home, hides the artifact, cleans up, and later meets friends so it looks as if he has just returned from California.  \n• On Monday morning he invents the “sun in my eyes yesterday afternoon” story to match Jim’s remark and to place him on the road when the crime happened, but the direction of travel contradicts his tale.  His beach sand and faulty timeline betray him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Denise – In an Aspen hospital until after noon Sunday, then driven straight home by her parents.  Broken leg plus medical records clear her.  \n• Skye – Airline records show her flight from Cozumel did not land until 1 a.m. Monday; impossible to be in Phoenix 14 hours earlier.  \n• Jim – Was still on the highway from Roswell during the theft, corroborated by fuel-receipts/toll-camera time stamps.  The desert sand he might carry matches local geology, not the foreign sand found.  \nOnly Juan lacked a solid alibi, possessed the special sand, knew the alarm code, and lied about when the sun bothered him.  Therefore he alone is guilty.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

          "reveal_segment": "Dr. Welsh continued: “Denise was still in the hospital on Sunday morning, so she couldn’t have stolen it. Skye’s plane didn’t arrive until late Sunday night, so it wasn’t her. Jim obviously drove home late in the day on Sunday as he was heading west and the sun was in his eyes. Thus, he’s not the culprit.\n“I’m sorry Juan, but you tripped yourself up with too much information. You drove home into the sun, like Jim did, but you were coming east on your way home. That means you drove home in the morning, not the afternoon, and so not only were you here, but you also felt it necessary to cover it up. Only the guilty person would have needed to do that.”\n“Officer, please take this young man away.”"
