      "content": "Jack Snyder had two great loves in his life: 1) old fashioned horror films (which by today’s standards are not horror films at all) and 2) his family. His priorities were not necessarily in this order. One of the great joys of Jack’s life was to invite one or more of his grandsons to spend Friday or Saturday night at his home. “Granddad Jack” and his grandsons would select a VHS tape or DVD from his extensive library and watch it in the family room after his wife, Candace, went to bed. The boys loved doing this. They felt like adults staying up later than their grandma. Also, Jack always made sure there was popcorn available. Turning off the family room lights and viewing an old black and white film on the big screen television added to the atmosphere. Andy, Matt and David genuinely enjoyed their granddad’s old films. Dennis, at age seven, the youngest of the boys, did not enjoy the horror films as much as the others, but did like to stay up late and eat popcorn. One Friday evening just after school was out for the summer, Candace and Jack agreed to keep all four boys for the weekend so their parents could take a three-day mini vacation – alone. The boys ranged in age from 13-year-old Andy to 7-year-old Dennis. 11-year-old Matthew was especially excited as it was his turn to pick out what they would view on this early June Friday night. After dinner, Jack and the boys went upstairs to his office library, a converted bedroom where he kept his collection in what used to be the bedroom closet. The closet doors had been removed for ease of access and the boys never tired of looking at it. Jack placed great emphasis on keeping the tapes and DVDs chronicled and placed in alphabetical order. Tonight, as always, every film in his library was accounted for and in its proper place. After much deliberation, Matthew selected Fall of the House of Usher, a 1960 film starring the great Vincent Price as the tormented Roderick Usher. This was one of Jack’s favorites. He was delighted that it was one of Matthew’s as well -- he had selected this film several times when it was his turn to choose. They took the DVD downstairs and placed it by the television in the family room. Jack and the boys were all set for what they referred to as their “Late Night Horror Show.” But, before grandma’s bedtime the evening lay before them. The Snyder’s backyard was huge and was the place of many family gatherings. Jack played with the boys outside on the swing set and also engaged the boys in pitch and catch. Candace sat in the sandbox with Dennis, who would shortly be too old to enjoy this any longer. Candace lamented that David had tired of it at about the same age Dennis is now. The six of them stayed outside until dark, a little over two hours. David went inside once to get soft drinks for everyone. At 9:00 p.m., the family came inside to clean up and watch television until grandma’s bedtime. The boys took turns showering and changing clothes in the downstairs bathroom. Jack dozed off in his chair as they prepared for the night. Candace was busy getting the boys clean clothes and watching bits of the news. After showering, Andy hobbled painfully to the kitchen for an apple. Candace gave him permission to sleep downstairs because he had twisted his ankle playing outside, and it was painful for him to climb the stairs. Matthew went upstairs to find his toothbrush but quickly yelled for Candace to come upstairs and help him find it. Matthew’s overnight bag was in the guest bedroom opposite the top of the stairs, and she observed him searching in vain for the toothbrush. As Candace’s bedtime approached, Jack went upstairs to turn off his computer, when he noticed his VHS copy of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman was missing from its place on the first row shelf. This was another of his favorites, a 1957 B horror/science fiction film starring the cult scream queen, Allison Hayes. Jack knew immediately what had happened: One of his grandsons had given in to the temptation to borrow one of his films. He wasn’t exactly mad, but was mildly annoyed as he had asked all of them not to do this numerous times. He was pleased that his grandsons shared his passion for these old films, though he wanted them to have more respect for his wishes. Going back downstairs, he called the family together and explained what he had found. Looking at all four of his grandsons, he said, “Fall of the House of Usher will begin when Attack of the 50 Foot Woman is returned to me.” Nobody said anything. Finally, Candace said, “I have seen and heard everything tonight. I know who has that silly film.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive\n   •  Andy – loves the old movies, but nothing in the story suggests an overpowering desire for this particular one.  \n   •  Matthew – it is already his turn to choose the evening’s feature, so he has no reason to steal a different title.  \n   •  Dennis – we are told he actually does not care for the “horror” films very much.  \n   •  David – has commented many times on the Attack of the 50 Foot Woman poster and “wants to see that film so bad.”  Clear, specific motive.\n\n2.  Opportunity (who was ever alone in the house while the tape could have been removed?)  \n   •  From the moment the whole group left the library until Jack discovered the gap on the shelf, the tape could be taken only during two intervals:  \n       a) while everyone else was outside playing, and  \n       b) after the family came back inside but before Jack went up to shut down his computer.  \n   •  Interval (a) – the only person who entered the house was David, when he “went inside once to get soft drinks for everyone.”  He had the house, and more importantly the upstairs, completely to himself for several minutes.  \n   •  Interval (b) –  \n        – Andy can barely walk and has been told he may sleep on the ground floor; going upstairs would have meant needless pain and was never observed.  \n        – Dennis is never reported upstairs at all.  \n        – Matthew is observed by Candace in the guest-room doorway looking for a toothbrush; she is with him virtually the whole time he is up there.  \n        – Candace herself is occupied with clothes and the television news until Matthew calls her; Jack is downstairs dozing.  So the library is unattended only during David’s trip for sodas.\n\n3.  Physical evidence / behaviour  \n   •  No one is found actually holding the VHS cassette, but David’s face “darkly” shows “surprise and horror” the moment his grandmother singles him out.  \n   •  When confronted he gives an immediate half-confession (“I just want to see that film so bad”) instead of a denial.  That statement is effectively an admission.\n\n4.  Logical deduction  \n   a)  The shelf was full when the entire family left the library.  \n   b)  The library was unattended at only one moment, David’s drink-run.  \n   c)  David alone has a strong personal wish to see that particular film.  \n   Therefore David is the only person who both wanted to take it and had an unobserved chance to do so.  When accused, his own words confirm it.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAndy Snyder, Matthew Snyder, David Snyder, Dennis Snyder, Candace Snyder\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDavid Snyder\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter supper the whole group picked out Fall of the House of Usher and left Jack’s library, the VHS copy of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman still safely on the first shelf.  \nDuring the two hours of outdoor play David, thirsty himself and wanting to impress everyone, volunteered to fetch soft drinks.  Once inside he hurried upstairs, removed the VHS cassette, slipped it into his backpack (lying open in the guest room), then ran back downstairs, collected the sodas and re-joined the others before anyone noticed how long he was gone.  \nLater, after showers, Matthew’s brief toothbrush hunt drew Candace upstairs, but she never looked in Jack’s library.  A few minutes afterward Jack went up to turn off his computer, saw the glaring space where the tape had been and sounded the alarm.  \nFaced with his grandmother’s neat deduction David’s nerve failed; he confessed and produced the tape.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAndy – His badly twisted ankle makes climbing the stairs both painful and unnecessary; he remains on the ground floor and is even given permission to sleep there.  \nMatthew – Although he does go upstairs later, Candace is physically with him, watching him rummage for a toothbrush in the guest room, not in the library.  He never has a free minute alone near the collection.  \nDennis – Never enters the upstairs area after the family’s first visit and has no liking for the old movies anyway.  \nCandace – She jokes that it is a “silly film,” but she has no motive to hide her own husband’s tape; moreover, when she is upstairs she is answering Matthew’s call, not sneaking into the library.  Her reasoning may sound brusque, yet the facts she cites are accurate and point squarely to David.  \n\nWith motive, opportunity and a spontaneous admission, David is clearly the only plausible culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
