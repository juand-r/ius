      "content": "There I was, enjoying a cup of coffee at the Lonesome Polecat Cafe, the western themed coffee house that was Centerville’s not very adequate answer to Cheyenne. Inspector Samuels of the Centerville Police entered the swinging tavern doors, narrowed his eyes at the darkened interior and squinted my way, then came charging towards my corner table like a halfback in search of paydirt in the last quarter. “So there you are, Crusher!” he said. “Your office said I’d find you here.” “So I am, Inspector. Wouldn’t it be easier if you carried a cell phone, like everyone else in town?” “Well maybe, but then I wouldn’t have any excuse to settle in here for a morning break and have a cup of coffee. As you are doing now.” Sally the waitress sidled over, took his coffee order, brought a steaming mug, and left. “Is this a case for Crusher Davis or Ask Martha?” (In other words, do you want my help directly, or do I use my advice to the lovelorn column in the Chronicle to get clues?) “You decide, Crusher. It’s that rash of thefts we’ve been having recently. There seems to be a pattern developing. I think we are dealing with a pickpocket. Maybe some of your readers would have noticed something, if you could survey them carefully. Or perhaps, you could get some information that would help us solve the case. Frankly, something about it doesn’t make any sense to me.” I trusted his instinct. “So, if Martha finds out who did it, that may make it unofficial.” “That’s about it, yes.” “Tell me about any recent cases.” “Sure,” Inspector Samuels began. “On Tuesday afternoon, Sam Cartwright’s wallet was lifted when he went shopping at our Home Depot. The money was taken, but the credit cards were not touched. The wallet was found in the parking lot.” “Sounds like the thief, if there was one, could have made more money by using the credit cards.” “Sure, but this isn’t New York City. It’s Centerville, after all, and Sam is well known. At 6 foot 5, and 240 pounds, he is almost as big as you are, Crusher.” He added, “You know, the same thing happened to Charley Eastern at the Safeway last week. I hadn’t put it together. The difference was that he found his wallet on the floor near the checkout cashier and nothing had been taken from it. But you know how he is, almost uncoordinated. He can’t put on his trousers without knocking a lamp over! So I didn’t make anything of it.” “Funny. Any more cases?” “Yes, just now, Mayor Greenleaf had his wallet stolen. He was at The Elegant Jewelry Shop picking out a present for Mrs. Greenleaf for their anniversary. Same story. He checked his wallet, and it wasn’t there. It was found outside the store on the sidewalk, cash gone, everything else still in the wallet.” “How about suspects?” “That’s too strong a word. But four high school students were very close to where the incidents took place. They are Sarah Browne, Morris Emerson, Johnny Anderson and Tom Blankenship.” “You mean, Inspector, that each of the four was at each one of the three incidents?” “Yes. Well, not exactly. Sarah was at the movies when Charley Eastern was shopping at the Safeway. But Johnny Anderson and Morris Emerson were in the Safeway when it happened, and Charley says he saw Tom Blankenship leaving the Safeway exit door for the parking lot just before he left the store.” “What about the other two incidents, when money was actually taken?” “All four were together on a class project at The Elegant Jewelry Shop when Mayor Greenleaf was there. They were ordering an engraved pair of cuff links for Coach Johnson. He did have a great football season this year, after all - the best since you used to captain the team “So they were all together?” “Yes.” “Was the Mayor wearing a jacket?” “Yes. I know where you are going. The wallet, he said, was in the inside right pocket.” “Were the four inside the store when he arrived?” “Sarah, Morris and Johnny were already inside the jewelry store while Tom had been parking the car and followed the Mayor into the jewelry store.” “Who left the jewelry store first?” “Mayor Greenleaf did. That’s when he found his wallet on the sidewalk and called me.” “And the Sam Cartwright theft at Home Depot?” “He told me that he saw all four youngsters in the store when he was shopping.” “Does he remember where they were in the store?” “Yes. Johnny was having an argument a few aisles away with another customer, and they were pretty loud. It seems that there was only one electric sander left in stock and each wanted it. Morris went over when he heard the argument and tried to calm things down.” “What about Sarah and Tom?” “They were the next customers after Sam Cartwright at the checkout counter.” “Anything else?” “No. That’s it. And I am afraid it is pretty thin.” “You said it. I’ll ask a few questions and try to get some answers, without anybody’s reputation being damaged.” “Yes, Crusher, that’s the tough part. Many thanks.” He finished his coffee and left. My “Ask Martha” column in the Chronicle the next day asked for help from high school students in solving a baffling crime wave. Many students emailed me to help. That included Sarah Browne, so I called her on my cell phone, and we met after her classes. “I’m so glad you are looking into this,” she said. “We all read your Ask Martha column, and everyone remembers when you played football here. We trust you. And frankly, the whole thing has just gone too far.” “What? You mean these thefts?” “Yes. The four of us thought it would be fun, and none of the money was spent, of course.” She gave me an envelope containing the money from the wallets of Mayor Greenleaf and Sam Cartwright, carefully counted, with a paper signed by her and the other three students. “But I guess our little joke went too far. You see, we are all in drama class, and we are putting on ‘Oliver Twist’ at the high school next month. I play Nancy of course, Tom is the Artful Dodger, Morris is Fagin and Johnny is Oliver Twist. We had practiced the pickpocket scenes, and then someone had the idea, ‘Why not actually do it? It would make great publicity for our play, and we’ll give the money back on opening night!’” “When your column came out, we saw things had already gone too far. Nobody made the connection between the play and the thefts. Anyway, I must confess, I haven’t been sleeping very well since this all began! And so our signed ‘confession’ was mailed to Inspector Samuels yesterday, before your column appeared.” “Well, he hadn’t opened it when he talked with me. What did you confess?” “We explained what we had done, and that we had the money to be returned immediately.” “Fair enough. But something is missing. If all four of you took the wallets, there is no mystery. On the other hand, I think just one of your little group actually took the wallets, so the mystery then becomes - which one of the four of you was the pickpocket?” “That’s it exactly!” “I know who it was,” Crusher said. “And if you can get your three friends here quickly, I’ll ask Inspector Samuels to join us. Prepare for a lecture, but I’m hopeful that with Ask Martha on your side, he’ll let you off and persuade Sam Cartwright and Mayor Greenleaf not to press criminal charges. Who knows, maybe there will be a publicity angle for the play after all!” She breathed a sigh of relief and called her three friends. “From now on, we’ll leave crime and detection to you and the police force,” she said.",

And so our signed ‘confession’ was mailed to Inspector Samuels yesterday, before your column appeared.” “Well, he hadn’t opened it when he talked with me. What did you confess?” “We explained what we had done, and that we had the money to be returned immediately.” “Fair enough. But something is missing. If all four of you took the wallets, there is no mystery. On the other hand, I think just one of your little group actually took the wallets, so the mystery then becomes - which one of the four of you was the pickpocket?” “That’s it exactly!” “I know who it was,” Crusher said. “And if you can get your three friends here quickly, I’ll ask Inspector Samuels to join us. Prepare for a lecture, but I’m hopeful that with Ask Martha on your side, he’ll let you off and persuade Sam Cartwright and Mayor Greenleaf not to press criminal charges. Who knows, maybe there will be a publicity angle for the play after all!” She breathed a sigh of relief and called her three friends. “From now on, we’ll leave crime and detection to you and the police force,” she said.\nSarah was at the movies when Charley Eastern’s wallet went missing. Thus, she could not be the pickpocket.\nMorris went over to calm the loud argument Johnny was having at the Home Depot, attracting attention to himself, which a thief would not have done. It also put him out of position to lift the wallet.\nJohnny was arguing at the Home Depot, removing himself from the spot where the theft of Sam Cartwright’s wallet occurred. Thus he could not have been the pickpocket.\nNot only is Tom Blankenship never exonerated, but he was the only one who could have taken Mayor Greenleaf’s wallet. He was outside the jewelry store, the only person in a position to steal Mayor Greenleaf’s wallet.\nIt took all of Crusher Davis’s persuasive abilities for Inspector Samuels to agree that no charges should be brought. Mayor Greenleaf, who was up for reelection, agreed, as did the other two victims. The fact that the confession was signed and mailed before the Ask Martha column even appeared showed contrition and was a strong point in the students’ favor.\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • All four teenagers are drama-class students rehearsing “Oliver Twist,” a play that turns on pick-pocketing.  \n   • They wanted some “publicity” and a little thrill, but by their own admission only one of them actually dared to remove the wallets; the other three merely went along.\n\n2. Opportunity incident by incident  \n\n   a) Safeway – Charley Eastern  \n      – Sarah is ruled out: she was at the movies.  \n      – Johnny and Morris were inside, visible and noisy (argument and peacemaking) – not the inconspicuous behaviour of a pick-pocket.  \n      – Tom was seen slipping out the exit to the parking lot just ahead of Charley – the only one in a position to have bumped Charley unnoticed, drop the wallet later, and leave before anyone looked for it.  \n      Result: only Tom had the real opportunity.\n\n   b) Home Depot – Sam Cartwright  \n      – Johnny is still occupied in a loud quarrel over the electric sander; Morris is beside him trying to calm things – both drawing every eye in the aisle.  \n      – Sarah and Tom are behind Sam at the checkout. Two possibilities exist, but the later evidence (see c) makes it clear which of the two actually acts.  \n      – Sam’s cash disappears, the empty wallet is later found in the car-park – a manoeuvre easily done by the boy who leaves the store first.  \n      Result: Tom again had the unobstructed chance to lift the wallet while Sam paid.\n\n   c) Elegant Jewelry Shop – Mayor Greenleaf  \n      – Sarah, Morris and Johnny are already inside when Greenleaf arrives.  \n      – Tom is outside parking the car; he follows the Mayor in.  \n      – When the Mayor leaves a few minutes later his wallet is already gone and is discovered on the sidewalk, not inside the store.  \n      – The only one outside with him (or able to slip out instantly) is Tom.  \n      Result: Tom alone fits the time-and-place window.\n\n3. Elimination / Alibis  \n   • Sarah has a rock-solid alibi for the Safeway incident; if she missed one theft she cannot be the single serial pick-pocket.  \n   • Johnny and Morris are repeatedly centre stage in loud confrontations that would make stealthy stealing impossible.  \n   • Tom is never exonerated in any incident and is positively placed where each theft occurs, sometimes as the only possible person.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   – Exactly one person must have performed the lifts.  \n   – Tom Blankenship is the only suspect who (i) is never ruled out, and (ii) has a clear, unshared opportunity at every theft in which money actually disappeared.  \n   – Therefore Tom Blankenship is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSarah Browne, Morris Emerson, Johnny Anderson, Tom Blankenship\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTom Blankenship\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nTom Blankenship, thrilled at playing the Artful Dodger, decided to perform real-life practice.  \n• Safeway: Slipping out to the car-park just ahead of Charley Eastern, he brushed past, lifted the wallet, found nothing worth taking, and quietly dropped it on the floor near the cashier on re-entering.  \n• Home Depot: While Johnny’s noisy quarrel and Morris’s mediation drew all eyes down the aisle, Tom fell in behind Sam Cartwright at the checkout, eased the wallet out, removed the cash on his way to the doors, and tossed the empty billfold in the lot. Sarah, beside him in line, never noticed.  \n• Jewelry Shop: Parking the car, Tom followed Mayor Greenleaf inside, noted the inside-jacket pocket, then stepped back out when the Mayor left. On the crowded sidewalk he executed one clean “dip,” pocketed the cash, and discarded the wallet immediately.  \n\nAfter Crusher Davis’s newspaper appeal frightened the foursome, Tom persuaded the others to sign a blanket “confession” and return the money, hoping their solidarity would hide his sole guilt.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Sarah Browne – Physically absent during the Safeway incident, therefore cannot be the single offender.  \n• Morris Emerson – During both thefts in which money vanished he is plainly visible pacifying Johnny’s quarrel, well away from the victims.  \n• Johnny Anderson – Engulfed in a loud dispute at Home Depot, and never outside with Mayor Greenleaf; like Morris he serves as an inadvertent distractor rather than a thief.  \nAll three lack continuous opportunity; only Tom is unruled-out in every case.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
