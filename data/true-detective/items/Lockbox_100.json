      "content": "Robert Caldwell always looked forward to the fourth Monday of each month. This was when the Mystery Club of the Caldwell and Zielny law firm met to discuss the next mystery challenge. The club was made up of himself, his partner, Peter Zielny, and several young attorneys who were salaried employees. This month, it was Robert’s turn to come up with a mystery challenge. As there were now six members within this group of mystery lovers, Robert knew that he would not have to do this again for several months. So, as his fellow group members entered the firm’s spacious conference room for the meeting, he was pleased with the mystery he had devised for this month. Robert greeted each member warmly with a smile and firm handshake. Coffee, soft drinks and club sandwiches awaited them as the meeting began. He began by saying, “For this month’s mystery challenge, we are going to do something different. We’re not going to participate in a whodunit, as we often do. And we’re not going to discuss a true crime mystery. Rather, this month we will act out our own mystery study right here in our own office.” This captured the attention of the group. Ronald Finch, the youngest and newest employee of Caldwell and Zielny, asked, “So what are we going to do?” Robert smiled. “One of you is going to deposit an item within lockbox 100.” Everyone knew what Robert meant when he mentioned lockbox 100. Within the offices of Caldwell and Zielny, which took up an entire floor of a downtown high-rise office building, there was a commercial vault with safe deposit boxes. The vault in the law office was not as heavy or secure as one would find in a bank, but it was larger in size. Many of the firm’s clients preferred to store valuable legal documents there. “Now, all of you know that the vault is in view of my office. The only thing is -- I can’t see everything inside of the vault because of the narrow doorway. Box 100 is on the left, out of view, and currently vacant. The mystery challenge is this: One of you must place the item within lockbox 100 during working hours when I am in my office. It must be done before close of business this Friday. It will be for you to decide who will do this and the challenge is for me to determine, by our next meeting, who has placed the item in the box.” Russell Winwood, an attorney for the firm who was scheduled to become a full partner within the next few weeks, asked, “What is the item?” “The item can be anything you can fit into the box,” answered Robert. “In case you don’t know, box 100 is a four inch by six inch box – and you are aware that our vault contains boxes as small as 3 x 5 inches and a couple as large as two feet by three feet – safes within a safe where we can store a client’s larger valuables temporarily.” “Anything else we should know?” “The only other requirement is that the chosen person must leave his name written on a piece of paper with the item for verification. Once more, the person placing the item must do it when I am in my office, so that I may see him enter and exit.” Robert placed a lockbox key on the table and said, “Here is the key to box 100. Before leaving, determine the item and the person for our mystery. The challenge starts tomorrow when I arrive for work.” The next morning was Tuesday, so Robert knew that one of his friends would be placing the unknown item into lockbox 100 before close of business Friday. He settled on this mystery in part because he had a light workload and would be able to monitor closely who entered the vault. As you would expect in a busy law office, all of the attorneys entered the vault for one reason or another several times during the week. By 6:00 p.m. Friday, the office had cleared out and he mentally recapped several of the week’s observations. Robert’s full attention was on the mystery. He thought, on Tuesday, Peter had entered the vault with a client. The client’s lockbox was one of those on a sidewall not visible from the doorway and Robert’s view. The client carried a vanilla folder with papers inside and Peter was coatless, carrying only the firm’s key to the lockbox. Later on Tuesday, Robert had seen Edward Frates enter the vault. Edward carried a big duffel bag with him, and upon leaving the vault, he carried only a pencil in his right hand. Robert reflected that on Wednesday, James Madigan entered the vault with a client. His telephone rang as he was observing them and he took his eye off of the vault for a few critical moments. When he looked back up, James and the client were exiting the vault. On Thursday, Robert recalled, as he sipped on a Coke and snacked on peanut butter crackers, Ronald and Russell had both been in the vault. Just after lunch, Russell had approached the vault with Jane Arens, his administrative assistant and asked her to wait at the door while he entered. Russell had his suit coat on and carried a briefcase. While watching the vault, Peter had come to the door of his office and asked a question about a pending legal case. They finished their short conversation just before Robert saw Russell leave the vault with Jane. Ronald had visited the vault later in the day, shortly before closing time. He was alone, and turned right when in the vault, removing himself from Robert’s view. He was in there a long time but finally exited a few minutes after closing time. Robert made a mental note to ask Ronald what he was doing in there so long if he were not the person placing the item. Robert sat at his desk quite a while recalling what he had seen during the week. As he chewed on his last cheese cracker, the answer came to him. Smiling to himself, he knew he was ready for the next monthly meeting of the Caldwell & Zielny Mystery Club.",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Understand the “crime”  \n   • Someone in the Mystery Club had to slip a small object (max. 4 x 6 in.) and a signed note into lock-box 100 during office hours while Robert sat in his glass-fronted office.  \n   • Robert can see anybody go in and out of the vault, but once a person is through the narrow doorway he can see only the passage straight ahead; boxes on the left (where #100 is) and on the right are hidden from him.\n\n2. List every visit to the vault that week (only club members matter):  \n   • TUES – Peter Zielny (with client, coatless, carrying only a key)  \n   • TUES – Edward Frates (alone, takes in a large duffel, comes out without it)  \n   • WED – James Madigan (with client; during part of the visit Robert is on the phone)  \n   • THU – Russell Winwood (with his assistant Jane waiting at the door, wearing suit-coat, carrying brief-case)  \n   • THU – Ronald Finch (alone, goes to the right side, stays a long time)\n\n3. Test each member for Opportunity + Practicality  \n   a) Peter  \n      – No place to conceal an extra object: no coat, no brief-case.  \n      – With a client; any odd move to the left wall would be noticed.  \n      – Least likely.\n   b) Edward  \n      – A duffel bag disappears, so he stored something bulky.  \n      – A duffel is far too big for a 4 x 6 in. box; clearly dealing with a different safe.  \n   c) James  \n      – Also with client; Robert off the phone in time to watch them leave.  \n      – Cannot credibly play a club prank in front of an outsider.\n   d) Ronald  \n      – Alone, but he plainly turned right, away from box 100 on the left.  \n      – Stayed a long time, but wrong aisle.\n   e) Russell  \n      – Had his coat on and a brief-case: plenty of hiding room for a small parcel.  \n      – Brought Jane; she waited at the doorway, partially screening him.  \n      – Exactly while Russell was inside, Peter conveniently appeared at Robert’s door with a legal question, stealing Robert’s attention for the only time Russell needed to slip to the left wall.  \n      – Nothing Russell carried in seemed to be missing on the way out—ideal for hiding a tiny box.\n\n4. Logical elimination leaves only Russell.  Peter’s “accidental” distraction corroborates: two partners colluded so the trick would work but Robert would still see Russell enter and exit, satisfying the game’s rules.\n\n5. Motive is simply club fun; Russell is the senior associate about to make partner, so others would gladly let him be the star of the stunt.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPeter Zielny, Edward Frates, James Madigan, Ronald Finch, Russell Winwood\n</SUPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nRussell Winwood\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter Monday’s meeting the six club members huddled privately and chose Russell to be the “mystery depositor.”  They agreed on a harmless item Robert loved—cheese crackers—and decided Russell would act on Thursday right after lunch, when traffic in the vault was light.\n\n1. Thursday, 1:40 p.m. – Russell dons his suit-coat, slips the small cracker box and note into his brief-case, and walks toward the vault with his assistant Jane Arens.  \n2. He tells Jane to stand just inside the doorway, facing out; her presence partially blocks Robert’s line of sight down the left aisle.  \n3. At the same instant, Peter appears at Robert’s office door with a question about a litigation file, drawing Robert’s eyes even farther from the vault interior.  \n4. Russell turns left, opens lock-box 100 with the club’s key, deposits the crackers and his signed note, locks up, and returns to Jane.  \n5. He exits still holding the brief-case (now empty of crackers) and looking perfectly normal.  \n6. Robert, having seen only the entry and exit, notes merely that Russell was “in the vault with Jane.”\n\nThe box sits undisturbed until Monday, when Robert opens it in front of the group and finds the crackers and Russell’s note.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Peter Zielny – Observed trip: coatless, nothing to conceal object, with client, could not discretely reach left aisle.  His later “distraction” of Robert shows collusion, not guilt.  \n• Edward Frates – Left a large duffel that physically cannot fit in a 4 x 6 in. box, clearly servicing a different safe for a client.  \n• James Madigan – With client the whole time; the prank required privacy.  Even during Robert’s short phone call, James and the client would still be together, making the trick impossible.  \n• Ronald Finch – Entered alone but turned right; box 100 is on the left.  He never crossed Robert’s sightline back toward the left wall.  \nBecause every other member is eliminated by physical impossibility or circumstance, Russell Winwood is the only one who could, and therefore did, place the crackers in lock-box 100.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "Robert was so excited that he asked the club members to meet after work the following Monday instead of waiting until next month’s scheduled meeting. They readily agreed. He commenced the meeting by stating, “I know who placed the item.”\nPeter asked, “What is it?”\nRobert replied, “I don’t know. I’m only required to know who placed it and I know who that person is.” Looking at the guilty party, he smiled and said, “It was you!”\nThe guilty one grinned back and said, “Explain.”\nRobert began by saying, “Well, it was indeed a challenge watching the vault all week. But, I stayed in the office late Friday and thought it through. Here are my conclusions:\n“On Tuesday, Peter entered the vault with a client. He escaped my view for a moment, but he was with a client and did not have his jacket on. The only thing he carried with him was the key to the lockbox, so it could not have been him for those reasons. Edward also entered the vault on Tuesday. He carried what appeared to be a duffel bag in with him, but did not have it when he came out. Obviously, he placed it in one of the temporary safes for a client. For sure, it would not fit in a four by six inch lockbox. I also know that James was in the vault with a client on Wednesday. Although I was on the telephone for part of the time he was in there, I know he would not be working our mystery challenge with a client by his side. I also know that Ronald was in the vault by himself just before closing time on Thursday. However, when entering, he turned right – away from lockbox no. 100 to the left.”\nEveryone now stared at Russell. All were smiling as Robert said, “So, it was you. I’m anxious to see what you placed in the box.”\n“Why are you so sure it was me who placed the item? You are going to look foolish if you are wrong.”\n“I’m not wrong. I’ve eliminated everyone else for the reasons stated. Besides, you entered wearing a suit coat and carrying a briefcase. You had ample room to hide an item. Plus, I strongly suspect that Peter helped you. He just happened to come to my office with a question while you were in the vault.”\nThe six men went to the vault and Robert opened lockbox 100 with the firm’s spare key. He found a small box of cheese crackers. A note inside read: Robert, Enjoy the crackers. You’ve earned them! Good job. -Russell Winwood"
