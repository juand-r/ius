      "content": "Summertime in the southwest is hot. Often, the days are filled with blazing dry heat in July and August, after the humidity of early summer ends around the Fourth of July holiday. And so it was on a hot August afternoon when a group of friends met with the intention of going swimming. It had been decided that morning that Tim McNair and his girlfriend, Linda Sheldon, would join their friends at David Kelly’s home before heading to one of their community’s neighborhood pools. As there were six of them, it was determined that at least two cars would be needed to travel the three miles to the pool. It would be a birthday celebration, as Tim’s birthday was the next day. First, they would have lunch at the Kelly home. David and his girlfriend, Nancy, Larry Roberts and Donna Allen were at the Kelly home when Tim and Linda arrived just after noon. It was already 93 degrees outside and getting hotter. Tim drove an early 1980s model compact car that was noisy but ran smoothly and offered dependable transportation. When Tim parked in front of the Kelly home, he and Linda could feel the heat of the hot asphalt beneath their feet, even through their thin sandals. As they approached the front door, Mrs. Kelly, David’s mother, greeted them warmly as she invited them into her home. Smiling, she said, “Hi Linda. Hello Tim. Are you ready for sandwiches and iced tea?” “You bet!” Tim replied, with enthusiasm. “Yes ma’am,” offered Linda. “Glad to have you here,” answered Mrs. Kelly. “You will have to excuse the house being a bit uncomfortable. The air conditioner isn’t working properly.” The newcomers joined the others at the kitchen table. As they were the last to arrive, they were also the last to finish eating. While Tim wolfed down his peanut butter sandwich and drank his iced tea, Larry and Donna excused themselves to go change into pool clothes. After visiting with Tim and Linda for a few minutes, David and Nancy excused themselves for the same reason. Linda and Tim spent the next few minutes finishing lunch and visiting with Mrs. Kelly. Mrs. Kelly was a wonderful lady who had a very nice way with young people. As they visited, Tim heard noises coming from outside the kitchen. Though, he didn’t think anything of it, as he knew his friends would be preparing to leave for the pool. A few minutes later, Tim and Linda left the kitchen for the living room. Donna and Nancy were sitting on the sofa. Donna wore a two-piece bathing suit with a towel wrapped around her and a pair of dirty sneakers. Nancy was dressed in a similar swimsuit and sat next to her with an insulated case of soft drinks by her bare feet. Larry and David were nowhere in sight. Tim asked where they were. “Getting ready for the pool, I guess,” said Donna. Tim felt that something was not quite right, but couldn’t put his finger on it. This time, he asked Nancy if she knew where they were. She replied, simply, “I don’t know.” Just then, David and Larry walked in the front door. Tim was startled, as he assumed they were in the back bedrooms changing. Larry had on a t-shirt and swim trunks. David looked a bit silly -- he was already wearing goggles and walking awkwardly in bulky flippers. “Tim asked, \"Where have you guys been?” “Outside,” answered David, “I had to rinse off my flippers.” Tim saw they were still damp. Larry offered, “I went outside with him.” Tim noticed Larry wore a brand new white t-shirt and commented on how fresh it looked. “Yes, it’s new. I just took it out of the package when I changed clothes – look, it still has package wrinkles in it.” Tim still sensed something out of the ordinary. However, he didn’t say anything except, “Well, is everyone ready to go?” His friends looked at each other sheepishly and answered in unison, “Yes.” Walking outside, Tim soon realized why he felt as he did, and why his friends were acting so strange. His car was missing! A light bulb went off in his head when he realized his friends had pulled a birthday trick on him. He was not angry or unduly surprised. After all, he was known for the pranks he pulled on his friends. He expected this playful revenge. Looking at them, he said, calmly, “You stole my car.” “Yes, but only one of us took it. Can you figure out who it was?” asked David. Tim laughed, “Well, I know you have a spare key so it would be easy for any of you to drive it away. But – I didn’t hear it start up when I finished lunch. I’m betting one of you pushed it out of sight. It’s a small, lightweight car and I’m sure one of you simply rolled it downhill and around the block.” “Could be,” said Larry, cryptically. “So, which one of us moved your car?” asked Nancy. Donna chimed in, “Figure it out fast. I’m ready to go swimming!” Tim looked at her and said, “It looks like you are ready for swimming, and I know who moved my car.”",

Often, the days are filled with blazing dry heat in July and August, after the humidity of early summer ends around the Fourth of July holiday. And so it was on a hot August afternoon when a group of friends met with the intention of going swimming.

Larry offered, “I went outside with him.” Tim noticed Larry wore a brand new white t-shirt and commented on how fresh it looked. “Yes, it’s new.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • All four friends (David, Nancy, Larry, Donna) have the same harmless motive – to play a birthday prank on Tim.  \n   • So motive alone cannot distinguish the culprit; we must look at opportunity and physical clues.\n\n2. Opportunity / Time-line  \n   • Larry and Donna left the kitchen first “to change.”  \n   • A few minutes later David and Nancy left the kitchen.  \n   • While Tim & Linda finished lunch they heard some noises outside – this must have been the car being rolled away.  \n   • Therefore the theft had to occur during the short interval while Tim & Linda were still in the kitchen and before Tim emerged into the living-room.\n\n3. Physical evidence and alibis  \n   • Nancy was sitting bare-footed on the sofa. The street temperature was over 93 °F (well above 100 °F on the asphalt). She could not have walked outside on the hot pavement with bare feet to push a car three blocks.  \n   • David re-entered the house wearing large rubber flippers; he was walking awkwardly and the flippers were wet because he had just rinsed them outside with the hose. It would be virtually impossible to push a car wearing flippers.  \n   • Larry appeared in a brand-new bright-white T-shirt that still showed the folded “package wrinkles.” If he had just pushed a dusty, oily compact car down the street in that heat, the shirt would be sweaty, dusty, and the crisp wrinkles would have fallen out.  \n   • Donna, however, was wearing dirty sneakers (the only practical footwear for pushing a vehicle on hot asphalt) and, oddly, she was still wrapped in a towel although the non-air-conditioned house was “uncomfortably warm.” The towel makes sense only as a way to hide perspiration-soaked skin or clothing. Her sneakers are dusty from the street.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   • Only one person’s clothing is both suitable for the job and shows evidence of having been outside: Donna Allen.  \n   • Thus, by eliminating the impossible or highly improbable (bare feet, flippers, pristine T-shirt) we are left with the only viable culprit – Donna.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDavid Kelly, Nancy (surname not stated), Larry Roberts, Donna Allen\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDonna Allen\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Larry and Donna excuse themselves first. They go to a back bedroom.  \n• Donna slips on her swimsuit, wraps a towel around herself, and laces up a pair of sneakers instead of pool sandals.  \n• Carrying Tim’s spare key (which the friends had borrowed earlier), she quietly goes out the front door, unlocks Tim’s little compact car, switches the gear to neutral, and single-handedly rolls it down the slight grade and around the next block, out of sight.  \n• On the hot August pavement she breaks a sweat; her sneakers pick up dust and grit.  \n• She walks quickly back to the Kelly house, slips inside through the same door, and sits on the living-room sofa next to Nancy before Tim finishes lunch. She keeps her towel wrapped tightly to hide the perspiration.  \n• A few minutes later David (in flippers) and Larry step outside briefly so that when they re-enter Tim will assume everyone had been outdoors, further muddying the waters.  \n• When the group finally walks outside, Tim notices the missing car, recalls the heat he felt earlier, and instantly identifies the only person whose clothing and condition match the deed—Donna Allen.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• David Kelly: Wearing large rubber flippers. Trying to push a car in those would be almost impossible; moreover, his flippers were freshly rinsed but not dirty or scuffed from asphalt.  \n• Nancy: Bare-footed when Tim saw her, and there is no sign she ever put on shoes. The scorching pavement would have burned her feet; therefore she could not have gone outside to move the car.  \n• Larry Roberts: His new white T-shirt still displayed crisp packaging creases and was spotless—no sweat stains, no asphalt dust, no shoulder smudges from leaning against a car. That could not be the shirt of someone who had just pushed a car several hundred yards in 95-plus degree heat.  \n• Only Donna’s apparel (sturdy, now-dirty sneakers) and her attempt to hide perspiration under a towel fit the physical requirements of the prank. Everyone else’s condition contradicts the possibility.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
