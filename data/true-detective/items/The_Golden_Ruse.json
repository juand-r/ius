      "content": "Jealousy and treachery had blighted the Yoxley Art Prize ever since it’s inception, there were even some who said it was cursed. The prize had been set up by the Lord of Yoxley in the late Eighteenth Century in an effort to improve his reputation as a cultural connoisseur. From its outset the event had been dogged by dishonesty, mainly due to the substantial financial reward that accompanied the winning place. Some dark rumors about how the Lord met his death had created sufficient romance to ensure that the competition endured through the years. One summer the group of hopeful artists and four judges gathered together for the competition with a certain sense of foreboding, as though some misadventure was at hand. Robert Yoxley, the modern day possessor of the title and estate, attempted to soothe his guests with a surprise buffet at afternoon tea. “Lovely day, isn’t it, Mr. Reese?” Robert asked the head judge. “It’s a lot of dashed nonsense that’s what it is, young man,” Mr. Reese gruffly replied. “Well, perhaps you would care for some refreshment from the buffet?” “Thank you, no. I’m only here because my wife insists upon it, and I’ve no wish to draw the proceedings out.” “Perhaps it would make it less tiresome if I were to suggest a change in the judging order? As you know only one judge is allowed into the showroom at any one time. You are down to go first, Mr. Reese, but I could put you last and so give you some time to attend the buffet if you wish,” Robert offered. “No, no, no, I don’t want to go last,” said Mr. Reese, “I’d rather get it over with.” “Very well, Sir, I only offered since you are such a distinguished guest. There is champagne laid out in the viewing room for our judges as well. Three very nice exhibits today; one gold, one silver and one bronze.” At that moment, to young Yoxley’s relief, the three other judges approached, they were Miss. Pendlebury, Miss. Jones and Mr. Horgan. “Hello Mr. Yoxley,” they chimed in unison. “We’re glad to finally join you,” Miss. Pendlebury said, “Mr. Horgan was so engrossed in the fresh cream tarts I thought we would never get away.” “You don’t begrudge me, surely, Miss. Pendlebury?” Mr. Horgan asked with a smile. “I begrudge the mess you’ve made of yourself with that cream,” Miss. Pendlebury said disdainfully as she looked at the marks on Mr. Horgan’s jacket. “The sooner all this idiocy is over with the better,” Mr. Reese said sharply, “show me in to the viewing room, Yoxley.” Robert scuttled in front of Mr. Reese as the old man stomped resolutely in the direction of the viewing room. “Well,” Miss. Jones said with a laugh, “I feel quite frightened now, if I take too long over my tea I’m sure Mr. Reese will accuse me of unprofessional behavior in his write up.” “When it comes to unprofessional behavior it would be strange to focus on your tea drinking when you’re dressed the way you are,” Miss. Pendlebury remarked. “What do you mean?” Miss. Jones asked. “A tight fitting dress and no jacket is hardly appropriate attire for an afternoon event. You’re not in the city now, dear.” “Well, I-,” Miss. Jones was cut short in her indignant reply by a tremendous creak from the viewing room. “Good gracious,” said Mr Yoxley as he approached, “that floorboard in the front of the gold exhibit creaks terribly. I must get it fixed. Mr. Reese is finished, Miss. Jones if you want to go in now.” Another terrific creak sounded a few minutes later and Mr. Yoxley ushered Miss. Pendlebury into the viewing room as Miss. Jones came out. “Sorry to leave you until last, Mr. Horgan.” “Oh no trouble, I can have another round of the buffet before I go in.” “No time for that,” said Miss. Pendlebury, as she suddenly appeared behind the little group. “But the board didn’t creak!” Mr. Horgan said. “Off you go,” Miss. Pendlebury snapped, coloring slightly. Later that afternoon the voting took place and it was announced that the gold sculpture was the winning piece. Robert Yoxley was speaking about the solid and robust nature of gold as he lifted the artwork up when it suddenly slipped from his hands and smashed into a thousand pieces at his feet. There was a burst of indignant commotion in the room and talk of high villainy was in the air. Gold, of course, does not shatter and the piece had clearly been switched. Angry suspicion fell upon the judges who had all had private access to the pieces one by one. Robert Yoxley, however, assumed a sudden attitude of command and insisted that he knew who was responsible.",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWhat had to be done?\n   •\tEnter the showroom alone.  \n   •\tBring in a light, gold-coloured imitation of the real gold piece.  \n   •\tExchange the two statues.  \n   •\tLeave with the heavy original hidden somewhere on one’s person.  \n   •\tIdeally be the last person to visit the room so that no later judge could notice the substitution before the culprit could slip away.\n\n2.\tWho could have carried the real statue out?\n   •\tMiss Jones – wears a very tight dress, no jacket, nowhere to hide a lump of metal.  \n   •\tMiss Pendlebury – wears a jacket and could conceal it, but she never even walked up to the gold work (the loose board that always creaked did not sound while she was inside).  \n   •\tMr Reese – had the clothes to hide it, but deliberately refused the offer to go in last, which is exactly what a thief would have wanted.  \n   •\tMr Horgan – large, loose jacket already smeared with cream, went into the room last and therefore had the best chance of escaping before the discovery.\n\n3.\tThe tell-tale cream\n   When Robert later lifted the ‘gold’ statue it slipped out of his hands because it was greasy with cream from the buffet.  \n   Of the four judges only one had been described as “so engrossed in the fresh-cream tarts” that he got the stuff all over his jacket – Mr Horgan.  \n   Therefore the person who handled the fake statue (and by implication the real one) immediately before the prize-giving must have been Horgan.\n\n4.\tThe creaking board\n   •\tThe board creaked when Mr Reese left and when Miss Jones left – they both walked right up to the gold piece.  \n   •\tIt did NOT creak while Miss Pendlebury was inside – she obviously stayed over by the champagne trolley and never reached the exhibits, so she cannot have touched, let alone taken, the statue.  \n   •\tMr Horgan’s passage is not described but there is no reason to think he avoided the board; in fact he had to stand on it to lift the statue.\n\nPutting motive (greed), opportunity (last in, roomy jacket), and physical evidence (fresh cream on the statue) together, the only possible culprit is Mr Horgan.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Reese, Miss Pendlebury, Miss Jones, Mr. Horgan\n</SUPECTS>   <!-- small typo labeled SUPECTS? we should maintain exactly tags \"SUSPECTS\" else; Keep as same heading but ensure closing tag matches? Provide both. -->\n Let's correct:\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Reese, Miss Pendlebury, Miss Jones, Mr. Horgan\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMr. Horgan\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nBefore the judging began Mr. Horgan stuffed himself with cream tarts, smearing his hands and the front of his loose jacket.  \nHe intended from the outset to steal the valuable gold sculpture.  For that reason he gladly accepted being the last judge to enter the showroom.  Once inside, he stepped up to the gold piece (the floorboard creaked, though no one was close enough to notice this time), lifted it down, slipped his light plaster duplicate into its place and pushed the real, heavy statue inside his already stained jacket.  His fingers were still greasy with cream, which transferred to the imitation.  \nNothing looked amiss, so he re-joined the others, apparently ready for the ballot.  \nWhen Robert Yoxley picked up the ‘gold’ to show the guests, the cream left by Horgan made it slide from his grasp.  The sham statue smashed, revealing the substitution, and the plot unravelled.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMr. Reese – a thief would have seized the chance to go in last; Reese insisted on going first, and he never approached the buffet, so there would have been no cream on the statue if he had handled it.  \n\nMiss Jones – her tight, jacket-less outfit offered no way of hiding a heavy lump of gold and she left obvious footprints on the creaking board, showing nothing unusual in her movements.  \n\nMiss Pendlebury – while she did have a jacket, the floorboard never creaked during her visit, proving she never went near the gold exhibit and so could not have removed the statue.  \n\nOnly Mr. Horgan had motive, opportunity, a hiding place and left the physical evidence (cream) that betrayed him.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",

Obviously one of the judges must have done this.”\n“This is outrageous,” boomed Mr. Reese, “are you suggesting that I would throw away my reputation on stealing such a piffling lump of rubbish?”\n“Now, please, order,” shouted Robert, “I’m sure it was not Mr. Reese.”\n“Quite so!” Mr. Reese boomed, “a man with my reputation-”\n“Your reputation does not exonerate you,” Robert said, “but the fact that you turned down the opportunity to go last does. “\n“What? How dare you, young man? My reputation is-”\n“Not as important as the fact that if you had been aiming to switch the pieces you would have taken last place when offered it, that way you would avoid the possibility that another judge might discern what had taken place.”\n“Now, look here-”\n“Nor can it be Miss. Jones,” Robert continued, trying his best to ignore Mr. Reese, “because her outfit presents no opportunity for concealment.”\n“No indeed,” Miss. Pendlebury said, “quite a different kind of opportunity if you ask me.”\n“You’re no stranger to opportunity yourself, if you will pardon me Miss. Pendlebury, since the floorboard never creaked while you were in the room I can only assume that you never approached the exhibit.”\n“What are you implying?” Miss. Pendlebury asked in an offended tone.\n“Simply that you decided to make for the champagne trolley instead of viewing the art works,” Robert said with a smile.\n“That just leaves you, Mr. Horgan,” Robert said, “and perhaps if you had not over indulged with the fresh cream at the buffet then you would not have got the statue slippery and I would not have dropped it. In that case no one would have noticed the switch until it was too late. It was always the maxim of my Great Grandfather, William Yoxley, that greed is a very dangerous vice.”"
