Here is a detective story. Please read the story carefully before you decide who the culprit is.

Note the reveal happens at the end of the story, specifically revealed here:

Analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is. Explain your reasoning step by step, considering characters' motives, opportunities and physical evidence or alibis, or any other clues you find relevant.

Most importantly: the culprit have been revealed in the reveal segment at the end of the story, so focus on that!

Solve the mystery. Write down your thought process here.

Who are the possible suspects? List them here:

<SUSPECTS>
<names(s) for all suspects here, comma separated>
</SUSPECTS>

Who is the culprit (or culprits, if more than one) and why? I want you to distinguish between the main culprit(s) and the accomplices (if any). If there are none, write None. If possible, include first and last names, as well as any aliases (if they have any). Answer in the form:

<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>
<name(s) here>
</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>

<ACCOMPLICE(S)>
<name(s) here>
</ACCOMPLICE(S)>

Now write down your reconstruction of the events of what actually happened.

Finally, explain why the other suspects are innocent.
