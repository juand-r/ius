Who are the possible suspects? List them here:

<SUSPECTS>
<names(s) for all suspects here, comma separated>
</SUSPECTS>

Who is the culprit (or culprits, if more than one) and why? I want you to distinguish between the main culprit(s) and the accomplices (if any). If there are none, write None. If possible, include first and last names, as well as any aliases (if they have any). Answer in the form:

<MAIN CULPRIT(S)>
<name(s) here>
</MAIN CULPRIT(S)>

<ACCOMPLICE(S)>
<name(s) here>
</ACCOMPLICE(S)>

Now write down your reconstruction of the events of what actually happened.
