You are evaluating an LLM's solution to a detective story mystery. Compare the LLM's identified accomplice(s) against the ground truth and assess correctness. The LM also predicted the main culprit(s) but you are only going to evaluate the accomplices.

Here are the list of suspects (not necessarily complete): {suspects} 


**Ground Truth: these are the actual culprit(s) and accomplice(s)**
Culprit(s): {ground_truth_culprits}
Accomplice(s): {ground_truth_accomplices}

Note "None" really means no *human* culprits or accomplices (other causes of death could include animals, nature, etc., these are still "None".)

**LLM Solution:**
Main Culprit(s): {llm_main_culprits}
Accomplice(s): {llm_accomplices}

Evaluate the LLM's solution and provide a structured assessment. First focus on whether the LLM correctly identified the actual culprit, even if first names or aliases are different or missing --- e.g., if the culprit is John Smith, but Matt Smith was predicted, that is considered correct (unless of course Matt Smith is a different suspect in the suspect list above). However, using the opposite gender (Mr. Smith vs Mrs. Smith) is a sign that the wrong person was accused.

**Assessment Guidelines for Accomplice(s):**
- "Accomplice correct?" is Yes if LLM identified the right person(s) as accomplices, even with name variations or a first name which may be incorrect.
- Only mark "Yes" if LLM identified ONLY the accomplice, or culprit and accomplice, not additional innocent suspects. If additional clearly innocent people are included as accomplices, write No. However, related roles or contextual details should be considered acceptable if the core correct answer is present.
- Note if only alias is provided when a real name exists, that's incorrect
- If the LLM gets one of the accomplices correct but misses some of them, still mark that as "Yes".

You will provide your assessment, answering three questions each for the accomplice(s):
1. Is the LLM predicted accomplice correct ("accomplice_correct")? 

2. Figure out if there are any minor errors: the predicted accomplice(s) might:
 (a) be missing an alias, or have the wrong alias (but acceptable title variations like Mr./Signor/Professor should NOT be flagged),
 (b) have a wrong (hallucinated) first or middle name: only mark this if the name is clearly wrong or fabricated. Common expansions (Joe/Joseph, Bob/Robert) or reasonable variations are acceptable. Only flag if the name is completely different or obviously made up,
 (c) be missing part of their name (first or middle name), and/or
 (d) be correct, but also include the culprit.

These errors are not always mutually exclusive.

3. Figure out if there are any major errors (fundamental misidentifications). If the accomplice is incorrect, then perhaps:
 (a) some other innocent person was accused instead,
 (b) the main culprit was demoted to accomplice (this is a major error even if all the right people are mentioned),
 (c) only the alias was given when the accomplice's real name was available, and/or
 (d) the right accomplice was accused, BUT other clearly innocent people were also incorrectly accused in addition. Related roles or contextual details should be considered acceptable.

These errors are not always mutually exclusive.

Provide your assessment in this exact format with separate JSON objects:

ACCOMPLICE ASSESSMENT:
{
  "accomplice_correct": "Yes or No"
}

ACCOMPLICE MINOR ERRORS:
{
  "accomplice_missing_or_wrong_alias": "Yes, No or N/A", # Only mark Yes if ground truth alias is completely omitted or clearly wrong. Title variations (Mr./Signor) are acceptable
  "hallucinated_part_of_name": "Yes or No", # Only mark Yes if name is clearly wrong/fabricated. Common abbreviations are acceptable
  "missing_part_of_name": "Yes or No",
  "included_culprit": "Yes or No"
}

ACCOMPLICE MAJOR ERRORS:
{
  "different_suspect_not_culprit": "Yes or No", # A completely wrong person was accused instead of accomplice
  "confused_swapped_accomplice_and_culprit": "Yes, No or N/A", # Main culprit was demoted to accomplice, while the actual accomplice is either not mentioned or listed as main culprit 
  "missing_real_name_only_has_alias": "Yes or No",
  "included_other_non_culprit_suspects": "Yes or No" # Clearly innocent people accused in addition to accomplice, (but related roles/contextual details are acceptable)
}

Edge Cases:
- ground truth of "None" means "no human culprit", so if the LLM mentions animals, diseases or any other non-human cause of death, that should be "Yes", correct.
- most mysteries involve a murder, but in some cases the culprit might be guilty of something else (depends on the story).

IMPORTANT: Provide your reasoning first, then provide each JSON section exactly as shown above.
