You are evaluating an LLM's solution to a detective story mystery. Compare the LLM's identified culprit(s) and accomplice(s) against the ground truth and assess correctness.

**Suspects:**
These are some of the susepcts (not comprehensive): {suspects}

**Ground Truth: these are the actual culprit(s) and accomplice(s)**
Culprit(s): {ground_truth_culprits}
Accomplice(s): {ground_truth_accomplices}

Note "None" really means no *human* culprits (other causes of dead could include animals, nature, etc., these are still "None".

**LLM Solution:**
Main Culprit(s): {llm_main_culprits}
Accomplice(s): {llm_accomplices}

Evaluate the LLM's solution and provide a structured assessment. First focus on whether the LLM correctly identified the actual culprit, even if first names or aliases are different or missing --- e.g., if the culprit is John Smith, but Matt Smith was predicted, that is considered correct as long as Matt Smith is not a different person in the list of suspects (the LLM probably meant John Smith but said Matt).

**Assessment Guidelines for Main Culprit(s):**
- "Culprit correct?" = Yes if LLM identified the right person(s) as culprit, even with name variations or a first name which may be incorrect.
- Only mark "Yes" if LLM identified ONLY the culprit or culprit and accomplice, not additional innocent suspects. If additional (non-accomplice) suspects are included, write No.
- Note if only alias is provided when a real name exists, that's incorrect
- If the LLM gets one of the culprits corrects but misses some of them, still mark that as "Yes".

You will provide your assessment, answering three questions each for the main culprits:
1. Is the LLM predicted culprit correct ("culprit_correct")? 

2. Figure out if there are any minor errors: the predicted culprit(s) might:
 (a) be missing an alias, or have the wrong alias,
 (b) have a wrong (hallucinated) first or middle name: either the name is different than the ground truth name, OR it mentions a first name when none is given in the ground truth,
 (c) be missing part of their name (first or middle name), and/or
 (d) be correct, but also include the accomplice in the list of main culprits.

These errors are not always mutually exclusive.

3. Figure out if there are any major errors (fundamental misidenfications). If the culprit is incorrect, then perhaps:
 (a) some other innocent suspect (who is not an accomplice) was accused instead,
 (b) an accomplice was selected as a culprit,
 (c) only the alias was given when the culprit's real name was available, and/or
 (d) the right culprit was accused, BUT other suspects were also incorrectly accused in addition.

These errors are not always mutually exclusive.

**Assessment Guidelines for Accomplice(s)**:
You will also answer all these questions for the accomplice(s) in the json below under "accomplice", the questions are the same but pertain to accomplices instead of culprits.

Provide your assessment in this exact format with separate JSON objects:

CULPRIT ASSESSMENT:
{{
  "culprit_correct": "Yes or No" # Yes if the actual culprit was chosen (even if the first name is made-up), and no innocent people were accused
}}

CULPRIT MINOR ERRORS:
{{
  "culprit_missing_or_wrong_alias": "Yes, No or N/A",
  "hallucinated_part_of_name": "Yes or No", # If first or middle name does not match ground truth
  "missing_part_of_name": "Yes or No", # Part of the actual culprit name is missing
  "included_accomplice": "Yes or No" # The accomplice is included together with the culprit
}}

CULPRIT MAJOR ERRORS:
{{
  "different_suspect_not_accomplice": "Yes or No", # An innocent person was accused instead of culprit
  "confused_swapped_culprit_and_accomplice": "Yes or No", # An accomplice was accused instead of the main culprit
  "missing_real_name_only_has_alias": "Yes or No", # The accused culprit is correct, but only referred to by alias 
  "included_other_non_accomplice_suspects": "Yes or No" # Innocent people accused in addition to culprit
}}

ACCOMPLICE ASSESSMENT:
{{
  "accomplice_correct": "Yes or No"
}}

ACCOMPLICE MINOR ERRORS:
{{
  "accomplice_missing_or_wrong_alias": "Yes, No or N/A",
  "hallucinated_part_of_name": "Yes or No",
  "missing_part_of_name": "Yes or No",
  "included_culprit": "Yes or No"
}}

ACCOMPLICE MAJOR ERRORS:
{{
  "different_suspect_not_culprit": "Yes or No",
  "confused_swapped_accomplice_and_culprit": "Yes or No",
  "missing_real_name_only_has_alias": "Yes or No",
  "included_other_non_culprit_suspects": "Yes or No"
}}

Edge Cases:
- ground truth of "None" means "no human culprit", so if the LLM mentions animals, diseases or any other non-human cause of death, that should be "Yes", correct.
- most mysteries involve a murder, but in some cases the culprit might be guilty of something else (depends on the story).

IMPORTANT: Provide your reasoning first, then provide each JSON section exactly as shown above, in exactly that format (without the # comments).
