You are evaluating an LLM's solution to a detective story mystery. Compare the LLM's identified culprit(s) and accomplice(s) against the ground truth and assess correctness.

**Suspects:**
Suspects: {suspects}

**Ground Truth:**
Culprits: {ground_truth_culprits}
Accomplices: {ground_truth_accomplices}

**LLM Solution:**
Main Culprit(s): {llm_main_culprits}
Accomplice(s): {llm_accomplices}

Please evaluate the LLM's solution and provide a structured assessment. First focus on whether the LLM correctly identified the key suspects, even if names/aliases are not perfect.

**Assessment Guidelines:**
- "Culprit correct?" = Yes if LLM identified the right person(s) as culprit, even with name variations or incorrect first name.
- Only mark "Yes" if LLM identified ONLY the culprit (or culprit + accomplice), not additional suspects
- If only alias is provided when real name exists, that's incorrect

You will provide your assessment, answering three questions each for culprit and accomplice: 
1. Is the LM culprit correct ("culprit_correct")? 
2. Figure out if there are any minor errors: if the culprit is correct, they may be missing an alias, have a wrong first name, or perhaps it included the accomplice in the list of culprits. These are "minor_errors"
3. Figure out if there are any major errors (fundamental misidenfications): if the culprit is incorrect, then perhaps a different suspect (who is not an accomplice) was accused, or the accomplice was selected as the culprit, or only the alias was given when a real name was available, or it included other suspects in addition to the actual culprit.
