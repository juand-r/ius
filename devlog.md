# Development Log

## 2024-12-20

**Testing**: Verified that both BMDS (34 items) and True Detective (191 items) datasets load correctly with the new path structure.

## 2024-12-20 - Full Book Collection Processing and Chapter Analysis

Completed comprehensive processing and analysis of the entire BooookScore collection:

- **Processing Results**: 80/100 books successfully split into chapters (80% success rate)
- **Content Validation**: 100% content preservation for all 80 successfully processed books
- **Scale**: 2,312 total chapters across 8,107,345 words
- **Statistics**: Average 28.9 chapters per book, 3,507 words per chapter
- **Extremes**: 
  - Most chapters: "the-house-is-on-fire" (95 chapters)
  - Longest average chapters: "a-day-of-fallen-night" (59,682 words/chapter)  
  - Shortest average chapters: "things-i-wish-i-told-my-mother" (858 words/chapter)
- **Visualizations**: Generated comprehensive box plots and statistical analysis saved to `plots/`
- **Deliverables**: Created reusable analysis pipeline and chapter length distribution visualizations for research use

## 2024-12-20 - Project Documentation and Planning

**Documentation**: Created comprehensive README.md explaining the IUS research framework, dataset formats, and key concepts including the distinction between documents, chunks, and incremental summarization strategies.

**Planning**: Developed detailed plan.md outlining the implementation approach for three core modules:
- `ius/chunk/`: Various chunking strategies (fixed-size, fixed-count, natural boundaries)  
- `ius/summarization/`: Baseline and incremental summarization with LLM abstraction utilities
- `ius/eval/`: Systematic experiment tracking, metrics, and analysis

**Strategy**: Confirmed approach to treat books as single documents (like BMDS/True Detective) rather than splitting into chapters. Will focus on getting everything working with BMDS dataset before expanding to other collections.
