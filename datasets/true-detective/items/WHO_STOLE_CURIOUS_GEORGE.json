      "content": "\"I'm 75 years old,\" shouted Mr. Ferguson, \"and I like Curious George!\" Everyone in the library stared at Mr. Ferguson, and Mrs. Yee, the librarian, glared, like she was trying to will him to talk more quietly. Even Mr. Ferguson's white hair seemed, like it was puffing away from his head in little tufts. But he was arguing with a seven-year-old! Mr. Ferguson had a round face and round eyes, and he looked like an angry pancake as he leaned down to make his point. \"The pictures are still funny!\" Mr. Ferguson insisted. \"And I'm glad when the monkey gets some help from his friend, the man with the yellow hat!\" Seven-year-old Skyler looked at him suspiciously. \"Maybe the books remind me of when I was young,\" Mr. Ferguson added wistfully. \"Back then, I had my whole life ahead of me.\" \"But now you're too old,\" said Skyler, and kicked him in the shins. Mr. Ferguson hated children, but he loved children's books. For 75 years he'd lived in Granville, but he'd never visited the library before. Now he visited every day, always checking out one of the tiny yellow Curious George books with their funny, cartoony illustrations. It was embarrassing when Skyler kicked him, or the librarian gave him a scolding look, but he really enjoyed the books. (And it was cheaper than going to the movies!) Sometimes Mr. Ferguson's eyes lingered over the pictures, and he imagined what it would be like to live on an island far away, like the monkey in the Curious George books. The daydreams were so wonderful, that it sometimes took a long time before he'd turn to the next page. But now Mrs. Yee was stomping over towards the children’s section to scold the two noisy patrons. Skyler took off to hide behind a tall bookshelf, expecting Mr. Ferguson to come and chase him. Despite all of this, Mr. Ferguson still thought most days in Granville to be pretty boring. The library was next to a water silo that said \"Granville\" in bold black letters, and there wasn't much to see on the one road through town. Granville Avenue had just a few stores on either side, plus a narrow building that doubled as the sheriff's office. When the children grew up, they moved away from Granville, and if you stayed, like Mr. Ferguson did, life was pretty quiet. Maybe that's why Mr. Ferguson liked the library so much. But there was one story that Mr. Ferguson had never read. The Granville public library had 34 different books that were all about the life of his favorite funny monkey. There was \"Curious George Goes to a Costume Party\" and even \"Curious George Goes to the Library.\" But now Mr. Ferguson was crouching by a floor-level shelf in the library's small children's section. He pointed his spectacles towards the books' spines so he could read every title for the book he was still looking for. “Curious George and the Pizza” Every day he’d looked through the other 33 books for that title. And every day it was gone. \"Checked out by someone else,\" he muttered, and that only made him want the book more. He never told any of the children which book he wanted and least of all, Skyler. But today, yet again, he'd have to check out a different book instead. Mrs. Yee, the librarian, seemed glad that the children's section had quieted down. Sometimes she wished she could throw out the noisy people and reserve the library for just quiet people. Yes, she'd read a story out loud every Wednesday at 2 p.m. for the children, but even then she talked in a soft, careful voice. Walking sadly to the checkout desk, Mr. Ferguson carried his second choice: \"Curious George at the Ballet.\" He tried not to look at the teenager behind the checkout desk, an intelligent looking youngster wearing glasses named Dexter. As Dexter ran his book over a laser scanner, Mr. Ferguson asked a question that would lead to a complicated mystery. Is it possible that a book could be stolen? \"There's no way!” said Dexter proudly -- pointing to the library's new anti-crime system. \"Our computer's pretty old so it can only track the adult books and the mysteries.\" But then he pointed to two tall rectangular panels, one on either side of the door. They were white and looked ordinary, but there was a fat wire connecting the two panels, and it led to a grey metal box on the wall by the checkout desk. \"Every book in this library has a small radio frequency transmitter.” Dexter said. \"If you tried to walk out the door with a stolen library book…” And then he pulled a book from the stack, and carried it over to one of the panels. The box on the wall made a very loud ringing sound as Mrs. Yee squealed in surprise. Dexter smiled proudly and said, \"It's not possible to steal a book. The alarm bells will always go off unless the book has been checked out.\" Mr. Ferguson said it seemed like a waste of time, which offended Dexter. It seemed like Mr. Ferguson was always offending people. He was sorry that he'd raised his voice today at the 7-year old, although earlier in the week he’d even raised his voice at Dexter! (\"It's never here!\" Mr. Ferguson had shouted. \"I check every single day, but the book that I want is never here!\" It had been early in the morning, and he'd been feeling cranky. He'd walked over a mile to get to the library only to once again be disappointed.) But on that day, shouting didn't seem to help. \"Shh!\" Mrs. Yee said fiercely. \"Maybe I'll feed the book to my dog and then you'll never come back and make noise in my library.\" Dexter smiled like he thought that was a good idea, so Mr. Ferguson just took a deep breath and checked out a different book instead: \"Curious George goes to the Dentist.\" But Dexter seemed happy today, proud to be triggering the loud alarm bells. \"See?\" he said smugly. \"It's just not possible to steal a library book.\" \"Except last Wednesday,” Mrs. Yee said angrily, just so she could disagree with Dexter. “What happened last Wednesday?” Mr. Ferguson asked. \"At 2:00, the box shorted a fuse for 10 minutes.” Dexter grumbled quietly. \"Because Dexter plugged a slide projector into the same circuit!\" teased Mrs. Yee. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The next day, there was a police car parked in front of the library. The sheriff's office was only two blocks away, but Granville's sheriff liked having an excuse to drive the police car around. \"I'm on official business,” he said to the librarian. \"What's that?\" asked Mrs. Yee, suspiciously. The sheriff looked down and mumbled under his breath. \"I need a copy of 'Curious George and the Pizza.'\" \"What?!\" squawked Mrs. Yee. The sheriff's face turned bright red, and he looked really uncomfortable. \"It's not for me,\" he said. \"The governor's family is having lunch in Granville today, and my wife wants to read a story to their kids. The governor is Italian-American, so she wants to read a children's book that's about pizza.\" Mrs. Yee was so excited about the governor that she clapped her hands loudly while Dexter checked the computer's records for the book. \"It says it's here -- it should be in the children's section.\" But the sheriff shook his head. The library had just opened, but he'd already checked in the children's section, and the book wasn't there. Mrs. Yee started to panic, while Dexter just looked hurt. \"Our library's anti-crime system is foolproof!\" \"There he is!\" shouted Mrs. Yee, pointing at Mr. Ferguson. \"He asks for that book every day! Arrest him!\" Mr. Ferguson glared back at Mrs. Yee, and then -- acting like a librarian – he said \"Shh!\" He was feeling even crankier than usual -- it was hot outside. And he didn't even think it was possible to arrest someone over Curious George. \"How come you're so sure I stole it?\" Mr. Ferguson said. \"I'm not the only one who wanted it. Mrs. Yee threatened to feed the book to her dog so I'd stop coming around making noise in your precious library. And when she said it, Dexter laughed! Maybe he stole it, and then hacked into the anti-crime system.\" \"Maybe Skyler stole it,\" Dexter suggested with a smile, \"just to keep Mr. Ferguson from having it.\" \"Does Skyler hate Mr. Ferguson?\" the sheriff asked. \"Well, he kicked him in the shins once,\" Dexter said. \"What are we going to do?\" wailed the sheriff. \"The governor's coming, my wife's counting on me -- and I want my Curious George!\" Can you help the sheriff find the book?",

The daydreams were so wonderful, that it sometimes took a long time before he'd turn to the next page. But now Mrs. Yee was stomping over towards the children’s section to scold the two noisy patrons. Skyler took off to hide behind a tall bookshelf, expecting Mr. Ferguson to come and chase him. Despite all of this, Mr. Ferguson still thought most days in Granville to be pretty boring. The library was next to a water silo that said \"Granville\" in bold black letters, and there wasn't much to see on the one road through town. Granville Avenue had just a few stores on either side, plus a narrow building that doubled as the sheriff's office. When the children grew up, they moved away from Granville, and if you stayed, like Mr. Ferguson did, life was pretty quiet. Maybe that's why Mr. Ferguson liked the library so much. But there was one story that Mr. Ferguson had never read. The Granville public library had 34 different books that were all about the life of his favorite funny monkey. There was \"Curious George Goes to a Costume Party\" and even \"Curious George Goes to the Library.\" But now Mr. Ferguson was crouching by a floor-level shelf in the library's small children's section. He pointed his spectacles towards the books' spines so he could read every title for the book he was still looking for. “Curious George and the Pizza” Every day he’d looked through the other 33 books for that title. And every day it was gone. \"Checked out by someone else,\" he muttered, and that only made him want the book more. He never told any of the children which book he wanted and least of all, Skyler. But today, yet again, he'd have to check out a different book instead. Mrs. Yee, the librarian, seemed glad that the children's section had quieted down. Sometimes she wished she could throw out the noisy people and reserve the library for just quiet people. Yes, she'd read a story out loud every Wednesday at 2 p.m. for the children, but even then she talked in a soft, careful voice. Walking sadly to the checkout desk, Mr. Ferguson carried his second choice: \"Curious George at the Ballet.\" He tried not to look at the teenager behind the checkout desk, an intelligent looking youngster wearing glasses named Dexter. As Dexter ran his book over a laser scanner, Mr. Ferguson asked a question that would lead to a complicated mystery. Is it possible that a book could be stolen? \"There's no way!” said Dexter proudly -- pointing to the library's new anti-crime system. \"Our computer's pretty old so it can only track the adult books and the mysteries.\" But then he pointed to two tall rectangular panels, one on either side of the door. They were white and looked ordinary, but there was a fat wire connecting the two panels, and it led to a grey metal box on the wall by the checkout desk. \"Every book in this library has a small radio frequency transmitter.” Dexter said. \"If you tried to walk out the door with a stolen library book…” And then he pulled a book from the stack, and carried it over to one of the panels. The box on the wall made a very loud ringing sound as Mrs. Yee squealed in surprise. Dexter smiled proudly and said, \"It's not possible to steal a book. The alarm bells will always go off unless the book has been checked out.\" Mr. Ferguson said it seemed like a waste of time, which offended Dexter. It seemed like Mr. Ferguson was always offending people. He was sorry that he'd raised his voice today at the 7-year old, although earlier in the week he’d even raised his voice at Dexter! (\"It's never here!\" Mr. Ferguson had shouted. \"I check every single day, but the book that I want is never here!\" It had been early in the morning, and he'd been feeling cranky. He'd walked over a mile to get to the library only to once again be disappointed.) But on that day, shouting didn't seem to help. \"Shh!\" Mrs. Yee said fiercely. \"Maybe I'll feed the book to my dog and then you'll never come back and make noise in my library.\" Dexter smiled like he thought that was a good idea, so Mr. Ferguson just took a deep breath and checked out a different book instead: \"Curious George goes to the Dentist.\" But Dexter seemed happy today, proud to be triggering the loud alarm bells. \"See?\" he said smugly. \"It's just not possible to steal a library book.\" \"Except last Wednesday,” Mrs. Yee said angrily, just so she could disagree with Dexter. “What happened last Wednesday?” Mr. Ferguson asked. \"At 2:00, the box shorted a fuse for 10 minutes.” Dexter grumbled quietly. \"Because Dexter plugged a slide projector into the same circuit!\" teased Mrs. Yee. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The next day, there was a police car parked in front of the library. The sheriff's office was only two blocks away, but Granville's sheriff liked having an excuse to drive the police car around. \"I'm on official business,” he said to the librarian. \"What's that?\" asked Mrs. Yee, suspiciously. The sheriff looked down and mumbled under his breath. \"I need a copy of 'Curious George and the Pizza.'\" \"What?!\" squawked Mrs. Yee. The sheriff's face turned bright red, and he looked really uncomfortable. \"It's not for me,\" he said. \"The governor's family is having lunch in Granville today, and my wife wants to read a story to their kids. The governor is Italian-American, so she wants to read a children's book that's about pizza.\" Mrs. Yee was so excited about the governor that she clapped her hands loudly while Dexter checked the computer's records for the book. \"It says it's here -- it should be in the children's section.\" But the sheriff shook his head. The library had just opened, but he'd already checked in the children's section, and the book wasn't there. Mrs. Yee started to panic, while Dexter just looked hurt. \"Our library's anti-crime system is foolproof!\" \"There he is!\" shouted Mrs. Yee, pointing at Mr. Ferguson. \"He asks for that book every day! Arrest him!\" Mr. Ferguson glared back at Mrs. Yee, and then -- acting like a librarian – he said \"Shh!\" He was feeling even crankier than usual -- it was hot outside. And he didn't even think it was possible to arrest someone over Curious George. \"How come you're so sure I stole it?\" Mr. Ferguson said. \"I'm not the only one who wanted it. Mrs. Yee threatened to feed the book to her dog so I'd stop coming around making noise in your precious library. And when she said it, Dexter laughed! Maybe he stole it, and then hacked into the anti-crime system.\" \"Maybe Skyler stole it,\" Dexter suggested with a smile, \"just to keep Mr. Ferguson from having it.\" \"Does Skyler hate Mr. Ferguson?\" the sheriff asked. \"Well, he kicked him in the shins once,\" Dexter said. \"What are we going to do?\" wailed the sheriff. \"The governor's coming, my wife's counting on me -- and I want my Curious George!\" Can you help the sheriff find the book?\nThe book was hidden in a drawer under the checkout counter and if the book were alive, it would've laughed at the funny people looking for it!\nMr. Ferguson didn't steal the book. He was still looking for it yesterday and no one looks for a book if they've already stolen it! The book wouldn't want to be fed to Mrs. Yee's dog, so it'd be grateful for the anti-crime system in the library. She could only have stolen the book in the 10 minutes when the security system was down, but that was right when Mrs. Yee reads her stories to the children -- every Wednesday at 2:00.\nEven if Skyler had wanted to steal the one book that Mr. Ferguson was looking for he wouldn't know its title. Mr. Ferguson never told any of the children which book he wanted and especially not Skyler.\nDexter had been trying to fool the sheriff and the clue lies in something he said. The library's old computer system only tracks adult books and mysteries. So there's no way he could look at the computer and then immediately announce that the children’s book was here. He had to be lying! (Dexter hadn't liked it when Mr. Ferguson insulted the anti-crime system by calling it a \"waste of time,\" so instead, he'd decided to waste a little of Mr. Ferguson's time!)\nHe was too embarrassed to admit it when the sheriff came in, but a few minutes later he pretended to find the book and handed it over to the sheriff. Though ironically, at the governor's luncheon, the sheriff's wife held the book too close to a candle. It caught on fire, and before they could put it out, the book had turned to a pile of black ashes.\nAnd then Mr. Ferguson never got to read it....\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive\n   • Mr. Ferguson – wants to READ “Curious George and the Pizza,” not destroy or hide it.  \n   • Mrs. Yee – is annoyed by noise, once joked she would “feed the book to my dog,” but she also wants every book to be on the shelf for patrons.  \n   • Skyler – dislikes Mr. Ferguson but has never been told the title of the book he wants.  \n   • Dexter – was personally offended when Mr. Ferguson called the new anti-crime system “a waste of time.” Dexter is young, proud of the new system, and would like to prove it can’t be beaten. Hiding the book is a way to get back at the old man while still “proving” no one can steal from the library.\n\n2. Opportunity\n   • Mr. Ferguson – can only handle the book while he is in the library; if he walked out with it the alarm would ring.  \n   • Mrs. Yee – is almost always at her desk, and every Wednesday at 2 p.m. she is in the story-corner reading to children (exactly when the alarm system was off). During those ten minutes she is in plain view of half the parents in town, so slipping away unnoticed would be hard.  \n   • Skyler – is seven; would have to pass the exit gates and set off the alarm.  \n   • Dexter – works behind the counter all day, has access to the drawers, can move a book without going near the exit panels, and knows which circuits cut the alarm.\n\n3. Physical evidence / statements\n   • The computer catalogue “shows” the children’s book is on the shelf. But Dexter himself told us the OLD computer “can only track the adult books and the mysteries.” Therefore it is impossible for the computer to say the children’s book is present. Dexter fabricated that information.  \n   • No alarm has ever sounded for that title, so the book never left the building. It must still be somewhere inside.  \n   • A drawer beneath the checkout fits the one place Dexter can hide something instantly and retrieve it later.\n\n4. Logical chain\n   a. The book never left the building (no alarm, no record).  \n   b. Someone who remains inside and has private storage must have it.  \n   c. Only Dexter fits that description.  \n   d. His false statement about the computer proves he is lying and therefore hiding the book.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Ferguson, Mrs. Yee, Skyler, Dexter\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDexter (the teenage library assistant)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter being insulted by Mr. Ferguson, Dexter decided to teach the old man a lesson and to demonstrate the “perfection” of the new anti-crime system. Last Wednesday, shortly before 2 p.m., Dexter quietly removed “Curious George and the Pizza” from the children’s shelf. Instead of taking it past the exit gates, he slipped it into a deep drawer under the checkout counter—well inside the protected zone—so no alarm sounded.  \n\nBecause the out-of-date computer does not even list children’s books, the catalogue continued to insist that nothing was wrong. When the sheriff later arrived looking for the very same title, Dexter pretended to consult the computer (“It says it’s here”) to hide the fact that he already knew exactly where the book was. After a few minutes of phony searching he “found” it—simply pulling it from the drawer—and handed it over.  \n\nThe governor’s luncheon copy thus came straight from Dexter’s hiding place, not from the shelf. Tragically, that copy was later destroyed in a candle flame, so Mr. Ferguson never did get to read it.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mr. Ferguson – Still hunting for the book every day; no thief searches loudly for something he already possesses. He could not smuggle it out because the alarm would ring.  \n• Mrs. Yee – Joked about feeding the book to her dog, but at the only moment the alarm was down (Wednesday at 2 p.m.) she was on public display reading stories. She had no private place to hide the book.  \n• Skyler – Did not know the book’s title and, as a seven-year-old, could not carry any unchecked item through the exit gates unnoticed.  \n\nAll evidence converges on Dexter; the others had either no means, no motive, or no opportunity.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
