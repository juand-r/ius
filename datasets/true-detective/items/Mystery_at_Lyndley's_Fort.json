Was it slow?\nPhiladelphia would know. On a cooling summer night,\nThey'd soon claim a brand new right. On the eve of history,\nyoung John Adams felt he'd see Chains of tyrants to be torn,\nand a nation's future born. Adams, Franklin, Hancock too\nKnew tomorrow what to do. With these great men in attendance,\nthey'd declare our independence. Soon in town squares through the land,\ncitizens would understand. There's a new rule for our people:\n\"All men are created equal.\" Kings' taxes would be ignored.\nLiberty was their reward. Newspapers would tell the nation\nThat they'd passed their declaration.

After only two weeks passed, \nrivalries were growing fast. Though America was new \nTo the British, some stayed true. Settlers who favored freeing\nfound these \"Tories\" disagreeing! For the views the settlers backed\nthey soon found they'd be attacked! So for shelter, they'd resort\nto the walls of Lyndley's Fort. Birds fell silent in the wood\nas these angry Tories stood, Some on foot and some on horse.\nBritish claims they would enforce. One brave man -- let's call him Nate\nTold the settlers to wait. \"If we stay here and survive,\na militia will arrive. \"It's exciting that we see,\nThat we are now living free But those Tories wish to end it.\nWe'll stand tall now, and defend it. Reinforced by all their men,\nwe'll be standing tall again.\" As the Tories rushed again,\nNate assured his loyal men, binding up the gates with rope,\nshouting \"while I breathe, I hope.\" As each gate rocked on its tether,\nThey'd all huddle here together. Tories shot the fort's wood wall.\nStill its gates were strong and tall. \"They'll have allies,\" Nate describes,\n\"living in the nearby tribes.\" Indians who long resented\nchallenges Nate's friends presented fought the former colonies\nto stop them from being free. Rifle shots and arrows too\nHit the gates but couldn't get through. Past the walls, the forest sounds,\nfell silent to bullet pounds. \"Still this fort's walls will protect us\nfrom the Tories who'd eject us.\" Nate knew everyone inside\nwould have no place else to hide. It was dusk now. Still alone,\nhearing Tory rifles moan, Nate's eyes scanned their wooden shell.\nAs outside the gunshots fell. To his horror, on one wall --\nsomething could destroy them all. Where the wooden walls were stocked,\none strong gate had been unlocked! His strong knot had been undone.\nWho has done this? Who's the one? Quickly Nate retied its knot.\nStill outside, more guns were shot. He'd investigate this breach,\nseeking what its clues would teach. \"I tied rope there,\" he'd decide.\n\"Someone left this gate untied. If attackers found that gate\nOur defense would be too late. Round the men up -- there were four\nwho'd stood guard beside this door.\" One of them had told a lie.\nInside was a Tory spy! \"Is it you?\" Nate asked the first.\n\"Leaving us to face the worst?\" It's a frontiersman named John,\nwho'd watched till daylight was gone After Nate's first knots were tied\nlate that afternoon inside. John came forward, thin but proud,\nspeaking in a voice quite loud, Answering, his voice excited, \n\"I know we will stand united.\" John said he'd seen knots that day,\nand they hadn't gone away. \"Though my wife -- as it grew late -- \nstood my last hour at the gate.\" John's wife nodded. \"This is true.\nI saw several knots there too.\" \"It was just an hour, though.\nAfter that, I'd had to go. I could see the new moon climb.\nIt was just past supper time.\" Nate confronted suspect three,\na young man from Tennessee. It's a teenager named Bo.\n\"That's untied? I didn't know. As I started, it grew late. \nSoon I couldn't see that gate! I'd assumed the gates were closed.\"\nNate searched in the eyes of Bo's. \"Was it always in your sight?\nDid you watch it through the night?\" \"No,\" said Bo. \"No, just, till two.\nThat was all that I could do.\" \"Please,\" said Bo, \"I'm just a peasant\nSleepiness was so unpleasant. Usually I work by daylight\non my farm, and sleep by midnight! I've worked hard to till the land.\nSee these fingers on my hand?\" Bo's left hand was badly crippled.\nThrough its skin, sore bumps were rippled. Though he'd work his farm till night\nhe'd hoe dirt with just his right. The fourth guard was Nathan Drew.\nTo this village he was new. But he'd sought the company\nof those men who would be free. Men who glowed with freedom's light,\nstanding by them in their fight. He'd been the relief for John,\nand had guarded them through dawn. All the night, as hours passed\nand they heard each Tory blast, He'd stood sentry by the wall,\ntrusted to protect them all. \"For us all, I'd risk my neck.\nUntied knots? I didn't check.\" But now Nate surveyed the four,\nchecking what he'd thought before. \"England will no longer rule us.\nBut one liar tried to fool us.\" Summoning a final clue,\nhe revealed what he knew. \"My knots are tied very tight.\nIt could take you through the night To untangle what I'd done\nWhile you hid from everyone.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Nate’s rope-work  \n   • He says he ties “very tight” knots that would take a long, steady effort to loosen.  \n   • Therefore the person who untied the gate had to remain at the gate for quite a while and needed two sound hands and adequate strength.\n\n2. Who had the opportunity (how long each person actually stayed at the gate)?  \n   • John: on duty most of the afternoon; his wife stood in for his last hour.  \n   • John’s wife: watched the gate only “just an hour”.  \n   • Bo: on duty only until 2 a.m.; then he left.  \n   • Nathan Drew: came on after John and, by his own words, “guarded them through dawn” – i.e. was at the gate for the longest, uninterrupted stretch when the knot could have been laboriously untied.\n\n3. Who was physically able to do it?  \n   • Bo’s left hand is “badly crippled,” so he could not have patiently worked loose a tight, heavy rope; Nate himself rules him out.  \n   • John’s wife would probably not have the strength to work the rope in the darkness within a single hour; Nate notes it “would take more power than she had in just one hour.”  \n   • John is vouched for by his wife, who personally saw the knots still intact when she relieved him.  \n   • Nathan Drew is young, strong, has both hands free, and had several hours alone—plenty of time.\n\n4. Motive  \n   • Nathan Drew is new to the settlement and therefore the least established patriot.  \n   • A Tory spy would volunteer for gate duty so he could sabotage the defense; that describes Nathan perfectly.\n\n5. Logical deduction  \n   • Only one person had the required combination of time (many hours), ability (two good hands and strength), lack of corroborated alibi, and a plausible hidden motive: Nathan Drew.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohn the frontiersman, John’s wife, Bo the teenage farmer, Nathan Drew\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nNathan Drew\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhen the militia first lashed the gates, Nate tied extremely tight knots.  \nJohn watched the gate all afternoon; the knots were still intact.  \nFor John’s last hour, his wife stood guard and likewise saw the knots secure.  \nBo took over but left at 2 a.m., exhausted and almost one-handed; the knots were still tight when he left.  \nAfter 2 a.m. Nathan Drew had sole charge of the gate until dawn. Working slowly and quietly in the dark, he painstakingly loosened Nate’s rope, leaving the gate unfastened so the Tory party outside could burst in.  \nBefore the attackers noticed, Nate made a routine inspection, discovered the loose gate, and retied it. Questioning the four guards and weighing time, strength, and testimony, he realized Nathan Drew must have been the saboteur and placed him under arrest.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• John: His wife personally inspected the knots during her relief hour and found them still secure. Therefore the gate was still tied after John’s shift.  \n• John’s wife: She watched for only an hour—far too little time to pry apart Nate’s famously tight knots—and they were still tied when she left.  \n• Bo: Even if he had wanted to undo the gate, his crippled left hand denies him the dexterity and strength needed, and he, too, had only a short window (before 2 a.m.).  \nOnly Nathan Drew had both the time and the physical ability, and his admission that he “didn’t check” the knots is an intentional half-truth designed to mask the fact that he untied them himself.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
