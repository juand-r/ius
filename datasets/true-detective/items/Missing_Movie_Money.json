      "content": "Kasey turned to her best friends just outside the door of Happy Burger. She managed not to squeal as she shared her news. “What you are about to witness is the incredibly adorable Cody Loman in action. He’s the new cashier, and he’s totally dreamy. Here, Tammy, hold my purse while I fix my hair.” “Oh no, not another one,” moaned Tammy. “And just how much older is this guy?” inquired Juliet. Kasey dismissed Tammy’s comment with a wave of her hand. “He’s just sixteen, only three years older than me. Oh, don’t look at me like that, my parents are seven years apart and they do just fine.” “Yeah, but they didn’t marry until after college,” muttered Tammy, but Kasey wasn’t going to miss her moment. “Okay, I’m ready,” declared Kasey. ”Come on you guys, you have to see him. Besides, I’m hungry, and the movie starts soon. You too Munchkin, let’s go.” Billy followed his big sister and her friends to the counter. He didn’t see anything special about this Cody, he looked like any other older boy. The girls seemed to think differently though. They did their best to flirt and act silly to keep his attention as they ordered. Kasey remembered to get a kid’s meal for her brother, and then handed over a twenty-dollar bill. Cody smiled right into Kasey’s eyes as he rattled off the numbers. Eleven fifty-eight out of twenty dollars, you get eight forty-two in change. His fingers touched her palm as he handed over the coins, and she giggled and blushed. Then he held up a folded stack of bills and counted slowly to eight as he flipped through them. He handed Kasey the bills with a wink and packed their food to go. Kasey kept her eyes on him while slipping her money into her purse, ready with a last smile for him when he delivered their meal. “You all be sure to come back now,” he encouraged them. “Don’t worry, she will,” chorused Tammy and Juliet. Kasey blushed even more, but waved daintily back at Cody as they walked out. The girls ate as they walked to the theater, talking with mouths full of burger and fries, and bursting out in laughter that threatened to spurt Diet Coke out their noses. Billy trailed slightly behind, enjoying his prize and thankful to be ignored for the time being. His peace ended just as they reached the theater. Tammy had just finished a chorus of “Cody and Kasey, sitting in a tree...” when Juliet chimed in with “Oh Cody, your buns are so toasty.” All three erupted in gales of laughter. Kasey had been drinking at that exact moment, so her eruption was more vivid by far. Fizz poured down her face and onto her favorite ruffled shirt. “Oh no! This is awful!” she gasped. “Hold this, Munchkin,” she commanded, thrusting her purse into Billy’s arms. Then she ran off to the theater’s restroom. The usher raised an eyebrow, but decided not to stop her. Kasey’s friends couldn’t help but keep snickering at him while they waited in the lobby for her return. Billy did his best to look like he wasn’t carrying a girl’s purse. Seeing one of his friends enter the theater, he quickly passed the purse over to Juliet so his friends would not see him holding a purse. When Kasey finally came back, she was composed and only slightly damp. Juliet handed back the purse, and Billy stood as far from his sister as he dared – not taking any chances she’d give it to him again. “All right ladies,” Juliet began, “tonight we have the choice of mermaids romancing lifeguards, government conspiracies, or flesh-crazed zombies. What’s it going to be? Step right up and cast your vote. You too, Shorty.” Kasey protested. “Munchkins only vote in the case of a tie.” It didn’t make a difference. Four votes were cast, and the decision was unanimous – flesh-crazed zombies it would be. They stepped over to the ticket counter and announced their decision. “Seven dollars each,” came the reply. The girls dove into their purses, digging through lipstick and photos, key chains, cell phones and bubblegum to find their funds. Kasey found her change but soon sounded a cry of outrage. “Where’s the rest of my money?” “What’s wrong, Kasey?” asked Tammy, concerned for her friend. Juliet looked worried too. “I only have half my money. I’m missing four dollars.” “Oh no,” said Tammy, “you didn’t drop it somewhere did you?” “How could I drop only half of my money? It was all folded together.” After another moment of thought, she declared “Someone must have stolen it!” Juliet spoke up. “Don’t go overboard, who would want to steal your money?” “Well…” Kasey looked for a likely suspect. “Each of you held my purse for a while tonight. Someone swiped my money while they were holding my purse. Each of you needs to show me your money so I can figure out who took it.” Billy got mad and yelled back in his high-pitched voice. “I didn’t take your stupid money, and I hate your ugly purse!” Kasey didn’t believe him, of course. “Let’s see in your pockets then.” Glaring at her, Billy turned out his pockets. Some green paper was revealed, he spread it out to show that it was a ten dollar bill. “Where did you get that?” snapped Kasey. “Mom gave it to me, she didn’t think you’d remember to save enough to buy me a ticket.” Kasey opened her mouth to respond, but stopped – realizing that she had indeed forgotten, even if she hadn’t lost four bucks. Juliet sighed. “Honestly Kasey, you aren’t going to have many friends left if you keep up like this. I only touched your purse for a moment tonight. The only way that I could have your money would be if I had teamed up with Billy and he had slipped me your money. And you know I don’t like the Munchkin.” Kasey was still suspicious. “Okay then, prove it.” “Well, all right…” Juliet walked over to Billy and punched him in the arm. “OW!” yelled Billy, and tried to kick her back. She stepped back and stared him down, so he settled for nursing his wound. Kasey was not amused. “That wasn’t what I meant. Show me your money.” “Oh, honestly.” Juliet had a five and two ones, just enough for the movie. As Kasey turned to Tammy, Tammy asked again, “You want to accuse your best pal of theft? I’m hurt. Are you sure you didn’t lose it?” Meanwhile she held out her money, which was seven singles.” Before Kasey could yell at Tammy, Juliet stepped in. “No, she didn’t lose it, and I know who did take it.” Kasey stared at her, expectantly. “All right, I’ll tell you, but you have to stop acting like a freak.” Kasey nodded humbly. With everyone waiting and listening to her, Juliet explained.",

Since he only has a ten-dollar bill, he obviously does not have your four singles. Likewise, I only have a five and two-ones, so I did not take it. We’ve settled that none of us took your money, and that you didn’t lose it, right? Then that leaves just one other person who touched your money tonight.”\nKasey still looked blank, so Juliet continued.\n“Hand me your money please – and don’t worry, I’ll give it right back to you.”\nHesitantly, Kasey gave her the four bills.\nJuliet demonstrated carefully, first folding the stack of bills in half, then counting down the ends one by one. “One – two – three – four – five – six – seven – eight. Here’s your eight dollars, ma’am.”\nKasey gasped as she took the money back. “Cody!” she shouted. “He distracted me with his charm while he stole my money!”\nTammy and Juliet both rolled their eyes, but nodded in agreement. The four hurried back to Happy Burger, and found Cody’s manager. He fired the unfortunate thief, gave Kasey her four dollars back, and offered them all complimentary drinks as an apology.\nThey made it back to the theater in record time, missing only most of the previews, and when the flesh-crazed zombies turned out to be uproariously funny, they all wound up laughing Coke out their noses.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What is missing?  \n   •  Kasey should have received $8.42 in change (eight $1-bills and 42¢ in coins).  \n   •  She later discovers she has only four $1-bills; the 42¢ is never in question.  \n   •  Therefore the theft occurred before the bills ever went into her purse.\n\n2.  Who ever touched the money?  \n   a)  Cody Loman – the cashier who counted it out.  \n   b)  Kasey – placed the bills directly into her purse.  \n   c)  Juliet – held the purse for perhaps two minutes.  \n   d)  Tammy – held the purse for perhaps thirty seconds.  \n   e)  Billy – never even touched the purse after the money went in, but he did hold it earlier at the theatre door.\n\n3.  Timing and opportunity  \n   •  The shortage already existed when Kasey slid the bills into her purse, because the purse stayed closed until the ticket line.  \n   •  Once the purse was shut, no one opened it again until the missing-money discovery.  \n   •  Therefore the only real opportunity was in the five-second interval while Cody had the twenty-dollar bill and was “making change.”\n\n4.  Physical clue – Cody’s “count”  \n   •  He folded the stack of singles in half, so eight separate edges were visible although only four sheets existed.  \n   •  By flipping the folded stack from end to end he could say the numbers “one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight” while actually delivering four notes.  \n   •  Juliet reproduces the trick for everyone, proving that the shortage occurred at the restaurant counter.\n\n5.  Motive  \n   •  Cody alone gains a benefit: four stolen dollars.  \n   •  The others would risk friendship and a movie ticket for a trivial amount; additionally they possess exactly the money they were expected to have (Tammy 7 ones, Juliet $7, Billy a $10-bill from Mom).\n\nConclusion: Cody is the only person with motive, means, and opportunity.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCody Loman, Tammy, Juliet, Billy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCody Loman\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhen Kasey handed Cody a $20 bill for the $11.58 purchase, Cody decided to steal.  \n1.  He placed four $1-bills together, folded the bundle in half, and palmed the other four singles.  \n2.  Holding the folded stack by one end, he counted “one–two–three–four” down one edge, flipped it, and continued “five–six–seven–eight,” creating the illusion of eight bills.  \n3.  Still flirting, he dropped the four real singles into Kasey’s hand along with the 42¢ in coins.  \n4.  Kasey, distracted by the eye contact and the theatrical counting, believed she had eight bills and slid them straight into her purse.  \n5.  Cody pocketed the four remaining dollars as she turned away.  \n6.  The purse passed briefly among the friends, but no one opened it, so the shortage was not discovered until ticket time.  \n7.  Juliet reconstructed the fold-and-flip trick, proving the bills were short from the start, identifying Cody as the thief.  \n8.  Confronted by the manager, Cody was fired and the money returned.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Tammy: She received the purse only after the money was already inside. She never opened it, and she possesses exactly seven singles—the amount she planned to spend on her own ticket.  \n•  Juliet: Like Tammy, she held the purse briefly but never opened it. She has a $5 bill and two $1 bills—again the precise amount she intended to pay.  \n•  Billy: He never touched the purse after the change went in, and he holds a single $10 bill given to him earlier by his mother. No $1 bills at all.  \nBecause the shortage predates any of them handling the purse, none of them had the opportunity to remove the four missing singles, leaving Cody as the sole perpetrator.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
