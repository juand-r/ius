      "content": "Forest View House was an isolated mansion owned by an elderly man named Mr. Howard Peters. One wild, autumn night, Mr. Peters was entertaining guests and in the small hours of the morning screams awoke the occupants of the house. Miss Lucy Smith had looked out of her bedroom window and seen the limp form of Mr. Peters hanging from one of the garden trees and started to scream. Everyone rushed out to the hanging figure. After staring at it for several minutes however, they could see that it was not Mr. Peters himself but an old first aid dummy dressed in his clothes. The confused party made their way back to the house only to discover that a priceless painting had been stolen while they were outside. Since the dummy and its clothing had all been taken from the house it stood to reason that the perpetrator was someone at Forest View. The matter was made more sinister by the fact that all four guests were beneficiaries in their host’s will. Mr. Peters telephoned for the police and an Inspector, a rake thin man named Alan Jefferies, duly arrived and promptly dropped down onto the nearest chair as though the walk from his car to the door of the house had exhausted him. The Inspector displayed his ID badge to the satisfaction of everyone except Dale whose poor vision compelled him to push forward to see properly and so tread on the Inspector’s foot in the process. “Well,” said Jefferies, after he had ascertained that he did not have to add a hospital visit to the already eventful morning, “I think someone should explain to me why you are all gathered here.” “It’s like this,” Mr. Peters began. “I wanted my four closest friends to gather here for the weekend as I had business to discuss with them. They are Daisy Morris, Dale Clark, Lucy Smith and Iain Potts. Daisy is my niece and she resides with me permanently; the others arrived by train yesterday evening. We all had dinner together, during which I revealed some changes to my will, and then we all retired to bed.” “What was the gist of these changes?” Inspector Jefferies broke in. “That there is no longer a fortune to be left to my four beneficiaries, at least not a very significant one, due to some bad investments I made. It was in the room where we had dinner that the missing painting was usually kept.” “Continue,” the Inspector said, noting that all the guests bristled visibly at the mention of their damaged fortunes. “Why is everyone so concerned about this painting? It’s not that valuable is it?” Lucy asked. “Very valuable, my dear,” Mr. Peters muttered. “Well,” Lucy went on, “it doesn’t seem very fair to eliminate our inheritances when you own a pricy bit of art. Why didn’t anyone tell me about it?” “You went to the bathroom,” Daisy explained to Lucy. “You weren’t there when Uncle told us about the painting. It was only a passing remark as it doesn’t affect the inheritance since it’s bequeathed to the local first aid school in Uncle’s will.” “I used to do volunteer work there,” Mr. Peters explained. “That’s why I have some equipment here in the house including the dummy that was used in this awful affair.” “I’ve been led to understand that the house was roused by Lucy’s screams,” the Inspector said. “That’s right,” Lucy replied. “I had to get up at two in the morning to take some tablets.” “Were the other guests aware of that?” Inspector Jefferies asked. “Yes they were. My windows look out onto the garden and I saw what I thought was poor Howard, murdered. I rushed out and one by one everyone else must have stumbled out of their rooms and followed to see what the matter was. I had only been staring at that frightful thing for a couple of minutes when Daisy came up behind me, Dale ran up next. It was very dark out there and all of a sudden we heard a yell and a crash. It turned out that Iain had tripped over one of the ropes used to secure what we now know was a dummy. That brought us all to our senses and we made our way back to the house.” Inspector Jefferies looked over at a man waving shyly at him from the couch with one hand and nursing his leg with the other. “Hurt badly?” Inspector Jefferies asked “Very, I’m afraid,” Iain said sadly. “Excellent,” the Inspector said, apparently unaware of the surprise in the people around him, “who discovered that it was not a real body?” “It was Dale who first made us aware of that,” Daisy replied. “We all thought it was real. It was too dark to get a clear look at the features.” “Mr. Peters, where were you during all this commotion?” Inspector Jefferies asked. “As I am rather infirm, it took me a while to get myself out of bed and down the stairs. By the time I came down everyone had returned. The nearest phone is in the dining room and so I went in there to call the police.” “We will proceed into that room Mr. Peters if you please, everyone else too,” Inspector Jefferies instructed. As soon as the group entered the dining room a small spaniel tied up on the far side of the table began to yap frantically. He showed no sign of stopping until Daisy, who was the owner of the little creature, went over and petted him until he reluctantly quietened down. “For goodness sake, Daisy, from the moment I woke up all I could hear was that canine racket and when I came in here to call the police I could hardly hear myself over his noise. He flies into a frenzy when he sees anyone other than you, you need to get him trained, there’s not a day goes by that-” “Uncle, the policeman doesn’t want to know about your domestic troubles,” Daisy said. “Oh, doesn’t he? Well, as I waited for the call to be answered I looked up at the wall here and that was when I saw that the painting had been stolen. Now, Inspector,” said Mr. Peters, “will you search the rooms?” “No,” said the Inspector, “no, I don’t think I would like to do that, your house is exceptionally large.” “-but” “Besides,” the Inspector continued, “I don’t need to search the house to tell you who took the painting.”",

          "reveal_text": "“It is clear to me,” the Inspector said, “that this revelation during dinner was a great blow to all four guests staying here. During dinner the conversation turns to the valuable painting and someone decides to steal it. It couldn’t have been Lucy since she was not in the room when this painting was discussed.\nThe thief knew an attempt must be made without delay. They could have sneaked downstairs and taken the painting during the night if it were not for the spaniel that barks incessantly, it would certainly wake the household if an attempt were made and give the game away. The fact that the spaniel was barking when the painting was taken proves that it was not Daisy who stole it.”\n“If I had come into the dining room my puppy would never have made a sound,” Daisy said as she patted the dog.\n“The thief set up a distraction on the lawn,” the Inspector continued,” something sufficiently terrifying to get everyone to run out of the house with no thought for anything but the apparent murder. I suspect a little bit of sinister revenge played a part in this choice of distraction since the thief was angry with Mr. Peters.\nEveryone knew that Lucy had to get out of bed and take her medicine during the night and so the dummy was placed on the lawn underneath her window in order that she would give an alarm when she saw it.\nAs we know when the alarm came everyone rushed out, except for Mr. Peters who spent a long time rising from bed. At this point the dog was already barking so the thief had snuck down first and entered the dining room as soon as they heard Lucy’s first scream, knowing that now the dog would be ignored in favour of the distraction on the lawn. The thief had only to take the painting, stash it somewhere in the house where they could get it later and then join the others.\nWhen the party ran out Iain tripped over a guide rope and hurt himself badly, he would never have had this accident if he had been aware of how the dummy was secured.”\n“Hey! I’d never have run and nearly broken my neck as well as twisting my ankle if I’d been able to help it,” Iain whined petulantly.\n“That was my point,” the Inspector said very slowly.\n“Oh, oh I see,” Iain said blushing.\n“Of course,” Inspector Jeffries said as he turned to look at Dale, “that only leaves one person.”\n“What makes you think it was me for sure?” Dale asked with a sly smile.\n“Because you demonstrated your poor eyesight when I showed my ID and yet it was you that apparently first managed to pierce the darkness with your vision and ascertain that the hanging figure was in fact a dummy.”\n“That would have been impossible,” Lucy cried.\n“Indeed it would have,” the Inspector said, “the truth of the matter is that Dale here knew that all along because he was the one that put it there.\nI think a cursory examination of the house will reveal the painting’s hiding place and if the rest of you handle your press interviews over these events sensibly I doubt that you will miss the inheritance money very much after all. Good day to you.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n•\tWho wanted the picture?  \n    – All four guests suddenly learned that their rich inheritances had vanished; only the picture was still worth a large sum.  \n    – Lucy did not hear that the picture even existed (she was in the bathroom), so she had no motive at that moment.  \n    – Daisy already lived in the house and would eventually inherit it anyway; besides, the dog is hers and would never snarl at her.  \n    – Iain and Dale both had motive.\n\n•\tWhat had to be done to steal it?  \n    1.\tRemove the picture from the dining-room wall.  \n    2.\tGet past the spaniel, which barks furiously at everyone except Daisy.  \n    3.\tCreate a diversion that drew the whole household into the garden long enough to act.  \n    4.\tKnow exactly where the ropes holding the dummy were so as not to trip over them later.\n\n•\tWhat diversion was used?  \n    – A first-aid dummy dressed in Mr Peters’s clothes was hanged from a tree outside Lucy’s window, guaranteeing Lucy would be the first to scream at 2 a.m. when she got up to take her tablets.  \n    – Whoever fixed the dummy also had to string two guide ropes to keep it steady.\n\n•\tWhat happened when the alarm was raised?  \n    – Lucy screamed.  \n    – The dog immediately erupted in barking.  \n    – Everyone stormed outside.  \n    – Iain crashed over one of the guide ropes and hurt his leg. If he had fixed the dummy he would have known the ropes were there; therefore he is not the thief.  \n    – While the others were in the garden, the thief slipped into the dining room, wrenched the picture from the wall, cached it elsewhere in the house and then re-joined the group.\n\n•\tThe spaniel’s evidence  \n    – When Mr Peters later entered the dining room to telephone the police, the spaniel was still tied there and still barking.  \n    – Therefore the thief was someone at whom the dog always barked (eliminates Daisy).\n\n•\tVisual evidence  \n    – In pitch darkness only one person (Dale) announced that the hanged figure was not a body but a dummy.  \n    – Yet Dale had just demonstrated his very poor eyesight by having to shove his face up to the inspector’s badge and even treading on the inspector’s foot.  \n    – A near-sighted man could not possibly identify a dummy high in a tree on a moonless, stormy night—unless he already *knew* it was a dummy because he had placed it there.\n\nCombining motive, opportunity, dog testimony, rope accident and the eyesight contradiction leaves only one coherent solution: Dale Clark.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDaisy Morris, Dale Clark, Lucy Smith, Iain Potts\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDale Clark\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter dinner Dale was furious that his inheritance had evaporated. Hearing Mr Peters mention the valuable painting, he resolved to steal it that same night.  \n1. Late at night he crept downstairs, took the first-aid dummy and some of Mr Peters’s clothes, carried them outside, hoisted the dummy into a tree beneath Lucy’s window and secured it with two guide ropes.  \n2. He tied the spaniel to a leg of the dining-room table, knowing the dog would bark at anyone except Daisy.  \n3. He then removed the painting, wrapped it, and hid it in a distant wing of the mansion.  \n4. At 2 a.m. Lucy opened her curtains to take her medication, saw the hanging “body” and screamed.  \n5. Everyone rushed into the garden. Dale waited just long enough in the house to be sure the others were outside, then joined them, arriving after Daisy but before Iain’s fall so as not to appear conspicuously absent.  \n6. Out in the dark he loudly announced that the figure was only a dummy—knowledge he had in advance—trying to appear helpful.  \n7. Iain, who knew nothing of the ropes, tripped and injured himself, proving he had not staged the display.  \n8. When Mr Peters later phoned the police the dog was still barking—a sign that the thief had never been Daisy.  \n9. Inspector Jefferies pieced these facts together and identified Dale as the only possible perpetrator.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•\tDaisy Morris – The spaniel would have remained quiet had she been the one prowling in the dining room; instead it was in full voice when the theft occurred.  \n•\tLucy Smith – She never heard the discussion about the painting, had no motive, and was the person who gave the alarm while the thief was already at work.  \n•\tIain Potts – His painful fall over a guide rope shows he was unaware of the dummy’s setup; had he arranged it himself he would have avoided the ropes.  \nTherefore none of them had the required combination of motive, opportunity and foreknowledge. Only Dale Clark did.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "“It is clear to me,” the Inspector said, “that this revelation during dinner was a great blow to all four guests staying here. During dinner the conversation turns to the valuable painting and someone decides to steal it. It couldn’t have been Lucy since she was not in the room when this painting was discussed.\nThe thief knew an attempt must be made without delay. They could have sneaked downstairs and taken the painting during the night if it were not for the spaniel that barks incessantly, it would certainly wake the household if an attempt were made and give the game away. The fact that the spaniel was barking when the painting was taken proves that it was not Daisy who stole it.”\n“If I had come into the dining room my puppy would never have made a sound,” Daisy said as she patted the dog.\n“The thief set up a distraction on the lawn,” the Inspector continued,” something sufficiently terrifying to get everyone to run out of the house with no thought for anything but the apparent murder. I suspect a little bit of sinister revenge played a part in this choice of distraction since the thief was angry with Mr. Peters.\nEveryone knew that Lucy had to get out of bed and take her medicine during the night and so the dummy was placed on the lawn underneath her window in order that she would give an alarm when she saw it.\nAs we know when the alarm came everyone rushed out, except for Mr. Peters who spent a long time rising from bed. At this point the dog was already barking so the thief had snuck down first and entered the dining room as soon as they heard Lucy’s first scream, knowing that now the dog would be ignored in favour of the distraction on the lawn. The thief had only to take the painting, stash it somewhere in the house where they could get it later and then join the others.\nWhen the party ran out Iain tripped over a guide rope and hurt himself badly, he would never have had this accident if he had been aware of how the dummy was secured.”\n“Hey!
