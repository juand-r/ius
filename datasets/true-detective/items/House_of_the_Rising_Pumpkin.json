      "content": "My friends and I rode up to Kim’s place and skidded to a stop in his driveway. He answered on the first ding-dong and invited us all inside, while he told his parents where he was going and what he was doing. Kim’s family had only lived in the United States for five years, and they were very protective of their son. They were also very interested in American customs, like Halloween, which was tomorrow night. “Hello, children,” Kim’s mother greeted us, coming out of the kitchen carrying a tray. “Would you all like some fresh-roasted pumpkin seeds?” Curtis shrugged his shoulders and scooped up a handful and popped them into his mouth. His face lit up like a jack o’ lantern as he discovered just how hot and fresh out of the oven they really were. Kim’s mother speaking in her broken English said, “American custom to carve up pumpkins and put candles in them and sit in front window. Korean custom not to waste anything.” Snatching a handful of seeds and chewing on them, Kim added, “Yeah, you should see the pies Mom baked. She made them out of the pumpkin we got – which is going to be the biggest and scariest on the block, by the way.” He turned to Dabney. “Are you ready to scope out our trick or treat route?” “Oh, yeah,” Dabney replied. “We’re going to hit maximum houses in minimum time this year, score the biggest load of sweets yet thanks to my planning.” He shook his head at Kim’s mother as she offered him the tray of pumpkin seeds. “I’ll take a pass, Mrs. Kwon. I’m actually allergic to seeds of any kind as some kids are allergic to peanuts.” We went outside and mounted our bikes. It was seven o’clock and already dark, with a cold wind blowing black clouds across the face of the huge moon hanging low in the night sky. “Spooky!” Curtis gulped. Taking the lead as usual, Dabney said, “Okay, goblins, I’ve got our Halloween route all mapped out in my head,” tapping the side of his overlarge cranium. “And Kim’s got the back-up on his GPS, just in case anyone gets lost. We’re gonna be so loaded down with candy tomorrow night, Curtis is gonna need my sister’s wagon to haul his load around.” Curtis was the smallest of the four of us with the muscular strength of an eight year-old girl. That is, as long as that girl wasn’t Dabney’s sister, Mary. She was built big and strong like her brother, and she just happened to be sitting on her bike across the street waiting for us. She had a serious crush on Curtis, for some reason. Dabney groaned when he saw her. “Uh, any of you ghouls object to the witch tagging along? I know Curtis won’t.” Curtis groaned back. We all put peddle to the metal chain and hit the streets, Mary pulling up the rear. We cruised right along Dabney’s chosen route, which featured densely packed streets and plenty of walk-up apartment buildings. It was a gold mine for treats, in other words. Half an hour later, we all skidded to a stop where the route and the sidewalk ended. Beyond was the old Mitchelson house, a boarded-up Victorian mansion sitting on a weed-strewn parcel of land that backed onto the river. Rumor was, the place was haunted. Under the cold, clouded moonlight, with a bitter wind making the dead leaves chatter and the skeleton trees dance, we could all believe it. “Hey, there’s a light on inside!” Curtis yelped, pointing at the eerie, dilapidated house. Kim, who wore thick glasses said, “I don’t see anything,” “Yeah, I don’t see anything, either,” I agreed, glancing nervously at the gloomy property. “No, I see something I tell you,” Curtis persisted. “There in the front window – a light flickering.” The guy was physically weak, but we all knew his eyesight was strong. “Let’s check it out, then, scaredy-cats,” Dabney said, always willing to take a dare or goad others into taking one. “I know just the person to lead the way.” He looked back over his shoulder and yelled, “Hey, sis, come here! We need you!” Mary eagerly peddled up to us. She smiled shyly at Curtis. Then, when her brother explained that she was going to be the first one through the door of the old Mitchelson house, she made a face like she’d eaten a rotten Halloween apple. “Oh, sure, great!” Mary whined. “You guys never include me in anything, unless it’s something dangerous or stupid. One day I’m going to get back at you … cowards,” she sniffed indignantly, as we all got off our bikes and crept across the overgrown lawn towards the shuttered and shunned house with an eight year-old girl leading the way. There was definitely a light in the front window of the abandoned mansion, that much was confirmed as we drew closer. It was faint, flickering behind tattered curtains, but it was there – even though nobody had been home for years. We stepped up onto the rotted porch. Mary tentatively reached out, grasped the hanging brass doorknob on the weatherworn door. Her brother shoved her from behind right through the door and into the old house. The hallway was shrouded in darkness. We tiptoed forward, floorboards creaking ominously. “In here!” Mary whispered up ahead. We rounded a corner of the hall and peered into the long-disused living room of the musty house. There was a candle burning in the front window – inside an enormous, evil-looking pumpkin! The wind whistled in the eaves and broken shutters slapped against the worm-eaten wooden sides of the house, as we stared at that glowering pumpkin, holding our breath. The thing had huge, grotesque eyes and a tremendous, broken-toothed grin carved into it, glowing orange and yellow by the light of the flickering candle, glaring almost right at us from across the shadow-laden room. I couldn’t see my friends on either side of me. But I could see that pumpkin – rising! I heard a squeaking sound, like a wheel turning. Then a high-pitched, girlish scream cut loose right next to me, almost blowing out my eardrums as sharp fingernails bit into my arm. The pumpkin rose right up into the air, hovering, grinning frightfully down at us. I was the first one out the front door, across the lawn and onto my bike. My ears were ringing, and my blood was running cold. I’m no hero. I didn’t stop peddling until I was back in Kim’s driveway. The rest of my equally heroic companions braked to a stop not far behind me. “The place is haunted! By a giant pumpkin!” Curtis gasped. “I-I don’t know if I even want to go out trick or treating tomorrow night,” Kim breathed. “Some American customs are just too scary.” Dabney wiped sweat off his pale forehead, as his saucer-eyed sister pressed her bike close to his. I started getting my breath back, the icy blood in my veins warming up enough to begin flowing into my brain again enabling me to think almost clearly. “Don’t fear the jack o’ lantern,” I stated boldly. “The old Mitchelson place isn’t haunted – except by a Halloween trickster. Somebody rigged that pumpkin to fly, in order to scare us. When we all go back there, we can figure out who.” Mary’s high-pitched scream made my ears ring all over again. It took some convincing and the assurance of Kim’s father’s cell phone and flashlight, but I finally persuaded my friends to ride back with me to the Mitchelson house. Once there, I quickly ran over to the still lit-up pumpkin, now resting comfortably back on its table and examined it up-close. Then I waved the others over with the flashlight. “See,” I said, grabbing onto the nearly invisible fishing line and lifting the pumpkin, with some effort. “This giant gourd didn’t jump up all on its own. Someone poked four small holes in it and threaded through some fishing line and then used a pulley system to reel the pumpkin upwards.” I shone the flashlight on the pulley screwed into the ceiling of the living room directly above the pumpkin. Then I shone a light on the guilty party. “I know who that someone is…..”",

I’m actually allergic to seeds of any kind as some kids are allergic to peanuts.” We went outside and mounted our bikes. It was seven o’clock and already dark, with a cold wind blowing black clouds across the face of the huge moon hanging low in the night sky. “Spooky!” Curtis gulped. Taking the lead as usual, Dabney said, “Okay, goblins, I’ve got our Halloween route all mapped out in my head,” tapping the side of his overlarge cranium. “And Kim’s got the back-up on his GPS, just in case anyone gets lost. We’re gonna be so loaded down with candy tomorrow night, Curtis is gonna need my sister’s wagon to haul his load around.” Curtis was the smallest of the four of us with the muscular strength of an eight year-old girl. That is, as long as that girl wasn’t Dabney’s sister, Mary. She was built big and strong like her brother, and she just happened to be sitting on her bike across the street waiting for us. She had a serious crush on Curtis, for some reason. Dabney groaned when he saw her. “Uh, any of you ghouls object to the witch tagging along? I know Curtis won’t.” Curtis groaned back. We all put peddle to the metal chain and hit the streets, Mary pulling up the rear. We cruised right along Dabney’s chosen route, which featured densely packed streets and plenty of walk-up apartment buildings. It was a gold mine for treats, in other words. Half an hour later, we all skidded to a stop where the route and the sidewalk ended. Beyond was the old Mitchelson house, a boarded-up Victorian mansion sitting on a weed-strewn parcel of land that backed onto the river. Rumor was, the place was haunted.

We need you!” Mary eagerly peddled up to us. She smiled shyly at Curtis. Then, when her brother explained that she was going to be the first one through the door of the old Mitchelson house, she made a face like she’d eaten a rotten Halloween apple. “Oh, sure, great!” Mary whined. “You guys never include me in anything, unless it’s something dangerous or stupid. One day I’m going to get back at you … cowards,” she sniffed indignantly, as we all got off our bikes and crept across the overgrown lawn towards the shuttered and shunned house with an eight year-old girl leading the way. There was definitely a light in the front window of the abandoned mansion, that much was confirmed as we drew closer. It was faint, flickering behind tattered curtains, but it was there – even though nobody had been home for years. We stepped up onto the rotted porch. Mary tentatively reached out, grasped the hanging brass doorknob on the weatherworn door. Her brother shoved her from behind right through the door and into the old house. The hallway was shrouded in darkness. We tiptoed forward, floorboards creaking ominously. “In here!” Mary whispered up ahead. We rounded a corner of the hall and peered into the long-disused living room of the musty house. There was a candle burning in the front window – inside an enormous, evil-looking pumpkin! The wind whistled in the eaves and broken shutters slapped against the worm-eaten wooden sides of the house, as we stared at that glowering pumpkin, holding our breath. The thing had huge, grotesque eyes and a tremendous, broken-toothed grin carved into it, glowing orange and yellow by the light of the flickering candle, glaring almost right at us from across the shadow-laden room. I couldn’t see my friends on either side of me. But I could see that pumpkin – rising! I heard a squeaking sound, like a wheel turning. Then a high-pitched, girlish scream cut loose right next to me, almost blowing out my eardrums as sharp fingernails bit into my arm. The pumpkin rose right up into the air, hovering, grinning frightfully down at us. I was the first one out the front door, across the lawn and onto my bike. My ears were ringing, and my blood was running cold. I’m no hero. I didn’t stop peddling until I was back in Kim’s driveway. The rest of my equally heroic companions braked to a stop not far behind me. “The place is haunted! By a giant pumpkin!” Curtis gasped. “I-I don’t know if I even want to go out trick or treating tomorrow night,” Kim breathed. “Some American customs are just too scary.” Dabney wiped sweat off his pale forehead, as his saucer-eyed sister pressed her bike close to his. I started getting my breath back, the icy blood in my veins warming up enough to begin flowing into my brain again enabling me to think almost clearly. “Don’t fear the jack o’ lantern,” I stated boldly. “The old Mitchelson place isn’t haunted – except by a Halloween trickster. Somebody rigged that pumpkin to fly, in order to scare us. When we all go back there, we can figure out who.” Mary’s high-pitched scream made my ears ring all over again. It took some convincing and the assurance of Kim’s father’s cell phone and flashlight, but I finally persuaded my friends to ride back with me to the Mitchelson house. Once there, I quickly ran over to the still lit-up pumpkin, now resting comfortably back on its table and examined it up-close. Then I waved the others over with the flashlight. “See,” I said, grabbing onto the nearly invisible fishing line and lifting the pumpkin, with some effort. “This giant gourd didn’t jump up all on its own. Someone poked four small holes in it and threaded through some fishing line and then used a pulley system to reel the pumpkin upwards.” I shone the flashlight on the pulley screwed into the ceiling of the living room directly above the pumpkin. Then I shone a light on the guilty party. “I know who that someone is…..”\n“That someone is … Kim.”\n“What!” he protested. “No! Dabney’s the one who planned the route – he knew our last stop would be the old Mitchelson house.”\n“True. But Dabney’s allergic to seeds, remember? He wouldn’t be carving out a pumpkin. Plus, he gave you the route to map out on your GPS.”\n“What about Curtis?” Kim parried.\n“Too small and weak to lug such a large pumpkin around,” I countered.\n“Mary?”\n“She was standing right next to me when the giant pumpkin rose up into the air, clinging to my arm. I have the fingernail marks to prove it. She wasn’t hoisting any pumpkin on a pulley. She was digging her fingernails into my arm.”\nKim grinned sheepishly. “Trick or treat?”\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive\n    •  Kim is the only person who repeatedly boasts about “the biggest and scariest pumpkin on the block.”  \n    •  He is eager to impress his friends and to show-off a knowledge of “American customs.”  \n    •  A classic Halloween prank fits his personality and his family’s love of using the whole pumpkin.\n\n2.  Opportunity\n    •  Only Kim already possessed a huge pumpkin (we saw the seeds and heard about the pies).  \n    •  He stayed home all afternoon and therefore had time to hollow it, carve it, thread the line and install the ceiling-pulley in the abandoned house before 7 p.m.  \n    •  He also copied Dabney’s route to his own GPS, so he knew exactly when the gang would arrive and could leave the candle burning at the right moment.\n\n3.  Physical evidence / alibis\n    •  The pumpkin used in the trick is very large and freshly cleaned out: Kim’s house had the fresh seeds and pies only minutes earlier.  \n    •  Dabney is allergic to every kind of seed—he would not have been scooping out pumpkin innards.  \n    •  Curtis is described as “the smallest of the four of us with the muscular strength of an eight-year-old girl.”  Lifting that monster pumpkin high enough to mount it on a pulley and then hoist it is beyond him.  \n    •  Mary was clinging to the narrator’s arm when the jack-o’-lantern rose; her fingernail marks are a direct alibi witnessed by another person.\n    •  The narrator had never been inside the old house before tonight and was the first to bolt in panic, making a secret set-up impossible.\n\n4.  Logical deduction\n    •  The trick required (a) access to a very large pumpkin, (b) time and strength to prepare the hoist, (c) advance knowledge of the group’s route, and (d) no seed allergy.  \n    •  Kim satisfies all four conditions, while each other person fails on at least one key point.  \n    •  Therefore Kim is the only logical culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nKim Kwon, Dabney (surname not stated), Curtis (surname not stated), Mary (Dabney’s sister), The Narrator\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nKim Kwon\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarlier in the afternoon Kim scooped out his oversized pumpkin at home.  While his mother roasted the seeds and baked pies, Kim slipped out with the emptied pumpkin, a reel of strong fishing line, two small pulleys and a short stepladder.  He bicycled to the abandoned Mitchelson house, entered through a loose board, screwed a pulley into the living-room ceiling beam, threaded the line through four tiny holes in the pumpkin wall, and tied the free end to a makeshift reel hidden behind a piece of fallen plaster.  Kim lit a candle inside, set the pumpkin on a table, tested the lift mechanism and left, knowing the candle would still be burning when he returned after dark.\n\nBecause Dabney had given him a copy of the Halloween scouting route, Kim knew the others would reach the old house at roughly 7 : 30.  When the gang entered, Kim quietly took hold of the fishing line in the darkness, waited for everyone’s eyes to lock onto the eerie face, and yanked.  The jack-o’-lantern floated upward, producing the squeak of the wheel and the shrieks he had hoped for.  In the stampede Kim simply released the line and let the pumpkin settle back onto the table, then ran out with the rest, pretending to be as terrified as they were.\n\nLater, when the narrator insisted on returning with a flashlight, the mechanism was still in place and the clues—freshly carved pumpkin, practically invisible line, ceiling pulley—pointed directly to the one boy who had the pumpkin, the strength, and the opportunity: Kim Kwon.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Dabney – His severe seed allergy makes carving a pumpkin hazardous; additionally, he never entered the house beforehand and had no time to set up the trick because he was with the group the entire evening.  \n•  Curtis – His lack of physical strength rules him out: the pumpkin and ladder would have been too heavy for him to manage alone.  His superior eyesight merely allowed him to notice the candle first; it does not implicate him.  \n•  Mary – She arrived only when the boys had already mounted their bikes, so she had no chance to prepare the house.  When the jack-o’-lantern rose she was busy squeezing the narrator’s arm, giving her a live alibi.  \n•  The Narrator – He was surprised like the others, fled first, and displayed no prior knowledge of either the house or the prank.  No motive is suggested, and he could not have installed equipment in a place he had never entered.",
