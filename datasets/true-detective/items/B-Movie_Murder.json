      "content": "Detective Cheryl Barnes and her partner Robert Simmons marched onto the set of \"Alien Invaders,\" a low-budget movie being filmed at a rented house in the Hollywood Hills. Cheryl looked at several alien costumes lying across a lawn chair and shuddered. “Boy these things are scary.” Robert nodded. “Yeah. I think my goose bumps have goose bumps.” The police were called when Clifford Lang, one of the actors, died in his trailer. The medical examiner removed the body and determined that poison had entered his system just before eight in the morning. Robert walked around the lot, while Cheryl examined Clifford’s trailer. In front of it lay a carpet that was immaculate, even though it was on the street. After a few moments, Cheryl walked inside the house and looked for the director of the film, Sal Digby. She found him in the kitchen. On the table beside Sal was a bag of herbs and vitamins. “Hello Mr. Dibgy. I’m Detective Barnes. I understand you were the first person to find Mr. Lang's body. Can you describe the circumstances?\" “Sure.” He opened up a bottle and swallowed a Vitamin C capsule. “All the actors were on set by eight this morning -- except Clifford. I found it odd because usually he was right on time. When he didn't show after ten minutes, I ran over to his trailer and knocked on the door. He didn't answer so I used my master key.” Sal swallowed another pill. \"I felt terrible when I saw him. He lay on the floor, next to a script -- his face white. I didn’t touch him.” Sal rubbed his hands together. “I don’t like to touch anything because I get sick very easily. It looked like he had passed away so I called Angela to take his pulse.” Sal felt his brow. “Is it hot in here?” Cheryl shook her head. Sal looked through his bag for something else and then gave up. \"There's a rumor that Mr. Lang and his leading lady didn't get along.\" The director shook his head. \"Not true. Angela is actually quite a nice person. She used to be a nurse. \"And Lang?” Sal began again to look in his bag. “If I can be honest here, he was kind of a prima donna. He made us cover the ground in front of his trailer with a rug so he wouldn’t get his fancy shoes dirty. Then he told us to make sure it’s cleaned at the end of each day.” He pulled out another bottle of pills. “Got it.” \"So with Lang out of the picture what happens with the movie?\" \"We'll do some re-filming and add a few computer tricks.\" Cheryl nodded. “I’d like to speak to Angela.” A few moments later, Cheryl sat in a dimly lit trailer across from the weeping blonde-haired actress. \"The murder occurred around eight. Can you tell me where you were at that time?” “Yes,” she said, wiping her eyes. “I had just sat down in a chair outside the house.\" \"Can anyone verify that?” \"Yeah, Sal could.” \"The story is that you disliked Lang. Care to elaborate?\" \"Actually, that's not true. We only tried to make it seem that way. In reality, we were...involved.\" Angela stood up and picked up a stack of letters from her table. \"These are love letters he wrote me.” She sniffed Cheryl raised her eyebrows. \"So why put on the charade?\" \"If people knew, it could leak out and end up splashed across the tabloids.\" \"I see,\" Cheryl said, glancing at the letters. \"He's thanking you here for your help. What did you do for him?\" \"Everything. He was diabetic. He would eat anything and everything and it was starting to show in his weight. I tried to help him as much as I could.\" When Cheryl walked outside, she noticed a man setting up a camera just outside the house. Cheryl showed him her credentials and asked his name. “Tom.” “Are you the only cameraman?” “On this cheapo-shoot? Yeah. They were supposed to have an indoor camera guy and outdoor one. But they didn’t have the budget, so I have to do both. Have to take all my equipment inside the house, then outside. Geez.” “How well did you know Mr. Lang?” “Very well. I hated the man. I shot two other pictures with him. Wouldn’t have done this one, but I needed the dough.” “Why didn’t you like him?” “He would always yell at me saying that I didn’t get his good side, or I didn’t keep the camera running during his ‘great’ adlibs. Geez.” “Can you account for your whereabouts at the time of the murder?” “Yeah, sure,” he said, adjusting a few levers on his camera. “It happened this morning, right? Well, at about seven-thirty, I took a walk in the park across the road to clear my head.” “What time did you get back?” “About eight.” Tom looked at all the dirt on his shoes. “Geez, this place is one horror story after another.” As Cheryl ambled back to the house, she noticed a young girl with horn-rimmed glasses exiting Angela’s trailer. \"Miss, can I speak to you for a moment? I’m...\" \"I know you're that detective, aren’t you? Word travels fast on a movie set.” \"You are?\" \"Debbie, the director's assistant. At least, that's my title. Basically, I'm a gopher.\" \"Where were you at eight this morning?\" \"I had just left Clifford’s trailer after giving him coffee. I know because I checked my watch to see if I was on schedule. He seemed fine then.” “What else do you do here?” “Sometimes, I have to track down things for the staff. Like on Tuesday, I had to get Sal some herbs from the health food store. And yesterday, Angela asked me to get her some Dragon Fruit. It’s a delicacy from Indonesia.” \"Why?” “She wanted to give it to Clifford. She told me it would help control his blood sugar.” “One final question. Why is a smart girl like you working as a gopher?\" \"For the connections. I'm going to be an actress.\" She smiled, showing off perfect white teeth. Clifford said he'd introduce me to some big-wigs.\" At that moment, Cheryl’s partner, Robert, walked over to her. \"Any luck?” “Yeah, I now know whose telling the truth and who's just acting.”",

He was the first one to find the body. He would have had plenty of time to poison Clifford.”\n“Yes, he might have had time. But he’s a hypochondriac and wouldn’t have wanted to touch any poison.”\n“Okay, what about Debbie. She went into Clifford’s trailer every morning to bring him coffee. She could have done something then.”\nCheryl nodded. “That’s probably true, but she wanted to be an actress and Clifford said he would introduce her to some people. She wouldn’t have wanted to ruin that connection.”\nRobert took a deep breath. “What about Tom? He said he hated Clifford.”\n“Yes, but Tom’s shoes were dirty. So if he had gone into Clifford’s trailer this morning, there would be mud all over the carpet. But it’s clean as a whistle.”\nRobert grimaced. “I give up. So who did it?”\n“Angela.”\n“Angela?”\n“Yes, she used to be a nurse so she would know about poisons. Using one of Cliff's insulin hypodermics, she injected poison into the Dragon Fruit. Angela left the fruit on Cliff's table, knowing that he would eat it. Clifford had never tasted this fruit before so he wouldn't notice the poison taste. I believe she did it because she was tired of taking care of Clifford.\nRobert nodded. “There’s only one thing scarier than aliens. That’s your crime-solving abilities.”\nCheryl smiled.",

Time the poison entered the body  \n   • The medical examiner fixes it at “just before eight”.  \n   • Clifford was alive, talking and perfectly well only a few minutes earlier.\n\n2.  Who was with him – or handled anything he consumed – in that exact time-slot?  \n   • 07:30–08:00 Tom is in the park.  He returns with muddy shoes.  \n   • “About eight” Debbie says she “had just left Clifford’s trailer after giving him coffee.”  \n   • 08:00 Angela says she was already seated in a chair outside the house; Sal is inside the house organising the day’s shoot.\n\n   Therefore the last person known to have been alone with Clifford within the lethal time window is Debbie.\n\n3.  Physical clues  \n   • The carpet in front of the trailer is “immaculate, even though it was on the street.”  \n     – Anyone with dirty shoes (Tom came back with mud caked on his) clearly did not step on it.  \n     – Debbie delivers coffee to Clifford every morning; she is used to tip-toeing across that rug and would leave it as spotless as always.  \n   • No mention of fruit peel, cut fruit, syringe marks on fruit, etc.  The evidence points to a drink (coffee) rather than to an exotic fruit that may never even have been given to Clifford yet.\n\n4.  Means  \n   • As the set gopher Debbie buys “herbs” and other odds and ends for everyone.  Getting hold of a fast-acting poison would have been simple for her and would raise no suspicions.  \n   • Dropping a few colourless drops or a crushed tablet into hot coffee is effortless and requires no special medical knowledge.\n\n5.  Motive  \n   • She tells Cheryl she is on the film “for the connections” and that Clifford promised introductions to studio “big-wigs.”  \n   • Angela, however, produces love-letters showing she and Clifford were secretly involved.  \n   • If Clifford was in fact promoting Angela (or planning to go public with her) while stringing Debbie along, Debbie loses both her promised career break and her pride.  That is a strong personal motive for a quick, angry murder.\n\n6.  Eliminating the others  \n   • Tom – provably away, and his muddy shoes would have ruined the spotless rug if he had visited the trailer.  \n   • Sal – hypochondriac or not, he never had the crucial last-minute access; if he had entered earlier the rug would show it, and he had no need to kill his bankable star ten minutes before a day’s shooting.  \n   • Angela – She was in sight of others at 08:00; moreover, if she genuinely loved Clifford and nursed his diabetes, murder would defeat her own interests.  No direct opportunity in the vital minutes either.\n\nThe only person with opportunity, unobtrusive means, and a believable motive is Debbie.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSal Digby, Angela (surname not given), Debbie (director’s assistant), Tom (cameraman)\n</SU SPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDebbie  (director’s assistant; surname not stated)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n07:50 Debbie makes the customary coffee run to Clifford’s trailer.  Resentful that his promised introductions have come to nothing – and having discovered his secret affair with Angela – she has already dissolved a dose of fast-acting poison in the coffee.  \n07:55 Clifford thanks her, takes the cup, and begins sipping while reading that morning’s script pages.  \n07:58 The poison reaches his bloodstream; he collapses.  \n08:00 Debbie walks out, checks her watch to confirm she is “on schedule,” and heads for the house.  The immaculate rug shows no trace of her fairly clean shoes.  \n08:10 Sal unlocks the trailer when Clifford fails to appear, finds the body, and summons Angela.  \nAfter 08:00 Debbie is seen leaving Angela’s trailer, having rifled it for anything (letters, notes) that might hint at motive or implicate her.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSal Digby – possessed a master key, but no verified access to Clifford in the ten-minutes window and would not risk destroying his own production so close to the day’s work.  \nAngela – Was visible outside at eight, had every reason to keep her lover alive, and lacked last-minute access.  Nothing ties her to the coffee or to any other object Clifford consumed just before death.  \nTom – Away in the park until eight; his muddy shoes prove he never stepped on the pristine rug leading into the trailer.  No time, no access, no clean shoes.  \nOnly Debbie satisfies all three necessary elements: clear motive, exclusive opportunity inside the crucial minute or two, and an unobtrusive method consistent with the evidence.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

He was the first one to find the body. He would have had plenty of time to poison Clifford.”\n“Yes, he might have had time. But he’s a hypochondriac and wouldn’t have wanted to touch any poison.”\n“Okay, what about Debbie. She went into Clifford’s trailer every morning to bring him coffee. She could have done something then.”\nCheryl nodded. “That’s probably true, but she wanted to be an actress and Clifford said he would introduce her to some people. She wouldn’t have wanted to ruin that connection.”\nRobert took a deep breath. “What about Tom? He said he hated Clifford.”\n“Yes, but Tom’s shoes were dirty. So if he had gone into Clifford’s trailer this morning, there would be mud all over the carpet. But it’s clean as a whistle.”\nRobert grimaced. “I give up. So who did it?”\n“Angela.”\n“Angela?”\n“Yes, she used to be a nurse so she would know about poisons. Using one of Cliff's insulin hypodermics, she injected poison into the Dragon Fruit. Angela left the fruit on Cliff's table, knowing that he would eat it. Clifford had never tasted this fruit before so he wouldn't notice the poison taste. I believe she did it because she was tired of taking care of Clifford.\nRobert nodded. “There’s only one thing scarier than aliens. That’s your crime-solving abilities.”\nCheryl smiled."
