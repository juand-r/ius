      "content": "Inspector Samuels couldn’t believe his eyes. He stared at the huge man who had just come through the door. He seemed to fill the office all by himself. Why, he was six foot five inches tall at least. “Actually, six foot six,” the man said. “It used to be my nickname, during basketball season. But that was before the football season started. Tech didn’t get many players weighing 265 in those days—that’s when they started calling me Crusher Davis.” “I can certainly see why,” Inspector Samuels blurted out. “What I don’t follow is this ‘Ask Martha’ business. The call from the Chronicle said that the reporter from the advice column—what we used to call the agony column—was on the way to see me. Martha. Everyone knows that is Martha somebody. Seems like everybody reads that column now. I mean, my wife tells me it’s interesting and well written.” “This has to be our secret, Inspector. I was a journalism major, and jobs are hard to come by. The Chronicle had an opening, but the person hired had to cover a number of items: City Hall, sports, local crime, and, oh yes, the advice column. Piece of cake for me, except for the advice column. It seems the Chronicle had dropped the syndicated column it used to run, to save money. That’s how I started to write ‘Ask Martha.’ “Funny how things work out. I got used to it after a few weeks. Having had two older sisters helped. And in high school, everyone was always coming to me with their problems, and I got into the habit of listening closely. That’s all most people want, anyway, and it does seem to help. So writing the column wasn’t really much of a stretch, and it does seem to have caught on. “But please, this must be our secret. For the time being, anyway, until somebody else starts writing the column.” “Whatever works.” Inspector Samuels was not about to argue with this giant. And besides, Crusher was here because he had offered to be of help with Samuels’ latest annoyance, a messy littering outbreak that had enraged half the city, and all of the taxpayers. “So what do you know about this littering?” “What everybody else knows: That it is widespread, messy, and deliberate. But I know something else. Based on the letters I received this morning, I think I can tell you either who did it, or give you the clue that will help solve the case. But I don’t want my cover as Martha to be blown. I’d be the laughingstock of the town! So what do you say to my giving you the facts anonymously, Inspector, and you figure it out? That way, Martha won’t enter into it, and I’ll keep my anonymity—and my job.” “You’re on, Mar—err, I mean Crusher.” “Good. There are four letters, Inspector. They all contain clues, and looked at closely, one might even tell us who is the litterer. I wouldn’t be surprised if that letter still had some fingerprints, or if the sender had licked the envelope flap to seal it, leaving some DNA. Too bad we can’t get that with stamps anymore. Now they are all stick-on, not licked. But there should be enough here to nail the litterer.” “Go ahead. I’m all ears.” “The first letter is signed Concerned Neighbor, who has this to say: ‘Every morning I go out to get the newspaper, about 6:45, and for the past week, it’s been getting worse. There is litter all around Maple Street, where I live. Some blew onto my lawn yesterday, and it looked like food wrappings of some sort, maybe fast food, with traces of what looked like mustard and ketchup. This is disgusting. What do we pay taxes for, anyway? The local police must be asleep at the switch.’ Concerned Neighbor then asks my opinion on whether he should organize a neighborhod patrol of some sort.” “Interesting. And the second letter?” “It’s from Smug in Suburbia. Smug lives in a gated community, which is locked up at night. Anyone leaving or entering the community from nine at night through seven in the morning has to go through security.” “So what’s he so smug about?” “He says, like Concerned Neighbor, that the problem behind the littering is the lack of proper police protection. But he offers a different solution. Hire more police, he says, and the problem would be solved. He admits that it would also lower the community association dues he and others now have to pay for their own private protection, but he says that’s only fair. He is a taxpaying citizen like everyone else. That is a cause that Martha should explore, he adds. He says that he is neat as a pin himself, and can’t abide litter. It’s a real health and safety issue.” “Makes a kind of sense. Who else is weighing in?” “It’s Perplexed Dog Walker. This is probably an animal rights person, and the letter, unlike the first two, is handwritten. It looks like a woman’s handwriting. Anyway, she goes out and walks her dog whenever the dog needs to go—no waiting until the morning. She is writing because she actually saw the littering happen. It was along the route she walks her dog, along Elm as it leads into Maple. She saw litter being thrown out of the front window of a car, the driver’s side, and not just once, but repeatedly. “She admits that she is not always careful with her own trash, the odd chewing gum wrapper, that sort of thing. But this was large scale, and shocking. There was no way that it was not deliberate. She says it must have been about one o’clock in the morning or so. She signs herself Perplexed, because she can’t understand why anyone would do this. Like Concerned Neighbor, she wants Martha to advise her about forming a community association of some sort, to patrol the area. She adds that she has been thinking of selling her home, and the housing market is bad enough without some idiot lowering property values with this littering campaign.” “Did she get a good look at the car?” “The car was a full block away, and it was fairly dark out, so she didn’t get a good look.” “I’m dying to find out what the fourth letter says.” “It’s from Confused Commuter. This one is also handwritten, a man’s handwriting. The writer says that he and his wife came home late one night from our state capital, after watching their son play tournament basketball. Their son’s team had lost, so he was in a very bad mood. They stopped at a fast food restaurant on Route 12—you know, that strip just outside of town—for a late night snack. He writes that he saw someone in the back, behind the restaurant, stealing one of the garbage containers that had been taken out for emptying into the dumpster when the night shift changed. He wrote Martha because he said he didn’t want to get involved in a police matter. They went home immediately from the restaurant.” “I think I’ve got it, Crusher. Many thanks, and your secret is safe with me. I look forward to your behind the scenes help with more cases as they come your way.”",

          "reveal_text": "The four letters together give a picture of the littering. Confused Commuter saw the litterer stealing a full trash container from behind a fast food restaurant. (He was with his wife, and went home immediately, so could not be guilty of sustained littering.) Concerned Neighbor saw the litter on his own block early in the morning. (A litterer would be very unlikely to strew trash all over his block, some of which would go onto his own lawn.) Perplexed Dog Walker saw that it was a repeated action, large scale. (Since she was trying to sell her own house, she would not litter the neighborhood and lower her own property’s value even more.)\nThat leaves the actual litterer, Smug in Suburbia. He wants to stop paying for private police protection at his gated community, and believes that his littering campaign will drive the city to hiring more people. We would not be surprised if he also plans to buy depressed properties in the neighborhoods where he has littered. The police will be helped by the records of the security guards at his gated community. Every night, they will have clocked him in and out, as he left the community for his littering campaign. The letter from Smug in Suburbia, even if it does not contain fingerprints or DNA—which would itself be a highly suspicious development—will soon be matched against those security records.",

He wants to stop paying for private police protection at his gated community, and believes that his littering campaign will drive the city to hiring more people. We would not be surprised if he also plans to buy depressed properties in the neighborhoods where he has littered. The police will be helped by the records of the security guards at his gated community. Every night, they will have clocked him in and out, as he left the community for his littering campaign. The letter from Smug in Suburbia, even if it does not contain fingerprints or DNA—which would itself be a highly suspicious development—will soon be matched against those security records.\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Identify everyone who could have perpetrated the littering: the four letter-writers, since the entire clue set is confined to what they say.\n\n2. Look for motive.  \n   • Smug in Suburbia complains about paying twice for protection (taxes + private guards) and openly advocates a change in city policing that would benefit him financially.  \n   • Concerned Neighbor wants the mess to stop, no discernible gain from making it worse.  \n   • Perplexed Dog Walker is trying to sell her house—litter hurts her sale price.  \n   • Confused Commuter was on his way home after watching a game; no continuing motive is shown.\n\n3. Consider opportunity and alibis.  \n   • Smug lives in a gated community with guards who log exits and entrances; this means he CAN get out at night but would be noted—a double-edged sword that he may think shields him (“I’m secure at night”) yet actually time-stamps his trips.  \n   • Concerned Neighbor is on Maple Street—exactly where the trash turns up. No one deliberately trashes his own yard.  \n   • Perplexed Dog Walker was out at 1 a.m. walking her dog and saw the trash tossed from a car a block away—an eyewitness, not the driver.  \n   • Confused Commuter was observed, with his wife, miles away on Route 12 that same night and then drove straight home.\n\n4. Look for physical/behavioral clues.  \n   • The litter consists of fast-food wrappings with mustard & ketchup. Confused Commuter saw someone steal a full trash can from the back of a fast-food place—exactly the supply needed by the litterer.  \n   • Perplexed Dog Walker reports “repeated” tossing from the driver’s window—fits a person deliberately emptying an entire garbage container while moving.  \n   • Only Smug has explained a broad policy aim (shift cost of policing) that would require the mess to be widespread and publicized—precisely what has happened.  \n   • Smug takes pains to insist he is “neat as a pin” (over-protesting) and that “hiring more police will fix it,” telegraphing his motive.\n\n5. Process of elimination plus motive/means/opportunity ⇒ Smug in Suburbia is the lone suspect who satisfies all three.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nConcerned Neighbor, Smug in Suburbia, Perplexed Dog Walker, Confused Commuter\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\n“Smug in Suburbia” – real name not given, a resident of the gated community; alias: Smug\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate each night, Smug in Suburbia signs out of his gated community, telling security he is “running an errand.”  \nHe drives to the Route 12 fast-food strip, pulls behind a restaurant, and steals a just-changed garbage can loaded with used wrappers, cups, and condiment-smeared paper.  \nHe then heads for the unguarded residential streets of Elm and Maple. While cruising slowly, he repeatedly pitches handfuls of the trash out of his driver’s window, blanketing yards and sidewalks.  \nHis goal: inflame public anger, discredit the city’s current policing level, and build pressure for the city to expand police coverage—letting him cancel or reduce the expensive private security contract inside his gated community and perhaps buy up devalued nearby property.  \nAfter emptying the bin, he drives back to his enclave before 7 a.m., where the guards log his re-entry.  \nThis pattern has continued for several nights, creating the “messy outbreak” noted by residents and the press.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Concerned Neighbor: The trash is on his own street and even on his lawn. Litterers avoid victimizing themselves; his letter is a straightforward plea for help. No motive or evidence ties him to stealing restaurant garbage.  \n• Perplexed Dog Walker: She witnessed the crime from a block away at 1 a.m. and is worried about property values because she hopes to sell her house—directly against any incentive to worsen the neighborhood.  \n• Confused Commuter: With his wife, he merely observed the theft of the garbage can, then drove straight home after a disappointing basketball game. Two witnesses, no reason to start a city-wide litter campaign, and the timing matches Perplexed Dog Walker’s account of seeing trash tossed while the commuter was already en-route home.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
