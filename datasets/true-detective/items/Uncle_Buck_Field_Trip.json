      "content": "I woke with a start. I had been calmly sleeping during my yearly Uncle Buck Memorial Day trip to the Baltimore aquarium with my nieces and nephews when I suddenly found myself totally soaked in cold salt water. Everyone around me was laughing hysterically. That is when I realized for the first time that I had obviously fallen asleep during the dolphin show. This was not the world’s brightest idea when your nieces and nephews have decided that all of you need to sit in the splash zone. Somehow the kids had talked me into sitting there today. Who knew that I would have fallen asleep only to have the dolphin send a torrent of water out of the tank with a single flip of its tail fin. (Sure, the kids probably knew, but detective or not, I surely did not know it.) Watching the replay on the big monitor, I had to admit that if it had been anyone other than myself getting soaked that way, I would have thought it was hilarious. Goodness knows that the rest of the audience was certainly getting a great big kick out of it. It had been such a good nap too. Fortunately the show ended soon afterwards and I was able to run to the gift shop to buy a T-shirt. As I finished shopping, I called my sister Tracy asking her what time we needed to be home for dinner. Fortunately, dinner was not going to be for several hours, so there was still time to sneak in a quick trip for ice cream with the kids. None of the kids’ Mom’s knew that each year after hitting the aquarium, I always took the kids out for their first ice cream cone of the year. It was an Uncle Buck tradition. The moms loved that I took them to the aquarium, while they prepared for the annual family BBQ. Rounding up the kids, I slipped my phone back into my shirt pocked and headed to the nearest rest room to try and dry off. As always, I directed all the kids to hit the rest room at the same time. Rusty was insistent that he did not have to go and said he wanted to get one more look at the stingrays in the main pool. Erika turned left while the other two boys and I headed to the men’s room on the right. Since Collin is only six, I went with him to the urinal to make sure he would be all right. Rory meanwhile headed into the stall. Anxious to remove my wet shirt, I hustled Collin along and then took him to the sink to wash his hands. When Collin was done washing his hands, I sent him to the hand dryers by the door and told him to wait for me there while I changed my shirt. It is truly difficult to describe the simple pleasure of removing a cold, wet shirt covered in salt water. Letting out a big sigh, I placed my shirt on the sink and grabbed some paper towels to dry off. As other audience members saw me changing, they all had another good laugh at my expense. Being a good-natured soul, I just laughed with them. It really was funny. As I put on my new T-shirt, I let out a little “YeeHaa”, letting the world know how good a clean dry shirt felt. I grabbed my wet shirt and put it in the bag the T-shirt came in and headed to the door to meet Collin and Rory. Rory was not there yet. Being the typical little brother, Collin of course yelled to his big brother asking if he had fallen in or something. He was thinking and hoping that maybe a shark had somehow eaten his big brother. It was after all an aquarium with lots of sharks all around. Finally, Rory came out of the stall and met us. At age 8, Rory was not going to let his brother’s comments go unnoticed and gave Collin his customary raspberry. Realizing that Rory had not washed his hands, I sent him back to the sink while Collin and I left the restroom to find the others. Fortunately, Erika and Rusty were right there so there was no need to go hunt them down. Moments later, Rory appeared so we all headed off for some ice cream. After all, one of the joys of being an Uncle is the chance to spoil your nieces and nephews. That of course also includes spoiling their dinner. As we headed to the ice cream parlor, the four kids kept whispering and giggling. Obviously they were up to something. But then, I am always up for a good challenge and they have not gotten one over on me yet, try as they might. (OK, they might have gotten a few over on me, but no way was I ever going to admit that.) Arriving at the ice cream parlor right down the street from the aquarium, the kids went into their normal, “We want triple scoop” pleadings. As always, I drew the line and told them that they could have one scoop only. Rusty said, “Well, why don’t you call our moms and ask them how many scoops we can have”. Knowing that their Moms would not be fond of them having ice cream before dinner, I said sure and reached for my phone. Quickly I realized it was not in my T-shirt pocket since I had no pocket on my T-shirt. Worse, it was no longer in the pocket of my wet shirt. That was when Rusty laughed and said that they had my phone and they would give it back to me if they could each have a triple cone. Blackmail!!!!! I could not believe that my own niece and nephews would do such a thing as to hold my phone for ransom. Granted, I would certainly have done exactly the same thing if I was in their position, but I could not let them know that. “OK. Here is the deal.” I said. “You can give me back the phone and I will get each of you a double cone as a reward. Or you can challenge me. If I can tell you who found the phone and where, single cones for everyone. If not, I will get each of you a triple cone. I will even throw in the topping of your choice. To make the bet even more interesting, if I do guess correctly, I get a triple. If I do not, I do not get a cone at all. Deal?” The four of them quickly huddled up to discuss the options. While double cones sounded really good to them, the thought of getting three scoops had real appeal, especially considering the added bonus of a topping. Unfortunately for them, they could not resist. “Deal” they all shouted at once. “But you only get to ask one question to figure it out and it can not be who found it or where.” Smiling, I said that question was easy. “What SINGLE flavor do each of you want on your one scoop since I already know who found it.” I turned to the counter person and with a great big smile on my face, ordered my triple cone. Of course I knew who did it.",

MOTIVE  \n   • All four youngsters shared exactly the same motive – to ransom the phone for more ice-cream.  \n   • Therefore motive does not discriminate among them; we must solve the case by opportunity and evidence instead.  \n\n2. OPPORTUNITY & TIMELINE  \n   • 12:15 p.m. (approx.) – Uncle Buck finishes his call to sister Tracy and slips the phone into the breast pocket of his WET button-down shirt.  \n   • The group splits to use the rest-rooms:  \n        – Rusty: stays outside to take a last look at the stingrays (never goes inside either wash-room).  \n        – Erika: turns left into the women’s room.  \n        – Uncle Buck, Rory (8) and Collin (6) enter the men’s room.  \n   • Inside the men’s room:  \n        1. Uncle Buck accompanies Collin to a urinal.  \n        2. Rory enters a stall.  \n        3. Buck takes off his soaked shirt at the sink, places it on the counter, towel-dries himself and puts on the new T-shirt.  \n        4. He gathers up the wet shirt, now minus the phone, stuffs it in the bag and leaves the men’s room with Collin.  \n        5. Rory is still in the stall.  \n        6. Outside the room Buck notices Rory has not yet washed and sends him back to the sinks alone.  \n        7. Rory emerges a moment later, hands washed and now in possession of the missing phone.  \n   • The only instant the phone could drop is when the wet shirt is lying on the sink.  \n   • The only person in the men’s room after that moment—and unsupervised—was Rory.  \n\n3. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE / ALIBI CHECK  \n   • Rusty: never entered either restroom → no physical access.  \n   • Erika: was in the ladies’ room; even if the phone did fall to the floor it was in the men’s room.  \n   • Collin: was either at the urinal with Buck, at the sink with Buck, or standing by the door being watched by Buck. No chance to search the sinks after the shirt was removed.  \n   • Rory: alone at the sinks after phone was lost; Buck himself sent him back there. No contrary alibi.  \n\n4. LOGICAL DEDUCTION  \n   • Phone was last known in wet-shirt pocket.  \n   • Shirt was placed on the sink ledge/counter; pocket inverted as it flopped → phone slides out into/near the sink bowl.  \n   • Buck never looked at the shirt again until it was stuffed into the bag, so he missed the phone.  \n   • Only Rory had free, unsupervised access to that precise spot at that precise time.  \n   • Therefore Rory had both opportunity and means.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRory, Rusty, Erika, Collin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nRory\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nUncle Buck finished his call to Tracy and stuffed the phone into the breast pocket of his still-soaked dress shirt.  \nIn the men’s restroom he removed that shirt at the sink to dry off, spreading it out on the counter. During the jostling the phone slipped from the pocket into the sink basin.  \nBuck, enjoying the relief of a dry T-shirt, failed to notice the loss, scooped up only the shirt and left with Collin.  \nMoments later Rory walked from his stall, was ordered back to wash his hands, and found the shiny phone resting in or beside the sink.  \nRecognising a perfect tool for an ice-cream shakedown, he pocketed it and rejoined the others. Outside, the four children conspired to “kidnap” the phone and ransom it for triple scoops.  \nWhen confronted with Uncle Buck’s single question, Rory’s unique opportunity made him the inevitable culprit.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nRusty – Never set foot in the men’s room; physically could not have retrieved the phone.  \nErika – Used the women’s restroom; she was never in the vicinity of the men’s sinks where the phone was lost.  \nCollin – Was constantly within Uncle Buck’s sight: at the urinal, at the sink with Buck, then waiting by the door. He never approached the sink area alone after the shirt was removed, so he lacked opportunity.  \nOnly Rory had unsupervised access to the exact location after the moment the phone fell; therefore the other three are cleared of any possibility of having taken the phone.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "The kids could not believe that I already knew. They refused to order until I told them who found it and when. I told them that since I had used the phone right before going into the bathroom, it was likely that it fell out while I was in the bathroom. Rusty could not have found it as he never went into the bathroom. While Erika went to the bathroom, since she is a girl, she went to the girl’s room and thus was not in the same bathroom. Therefore, she could not have found it. Collin was standing by the door when I took off my shirt. I was next to him when he was by the sink. Clearly, the phone fell out of the pocket of my wet shirt when I took it off. It fell into the sink, which is why I did not find it. When Rory went back to wash his hands, he found it.\nRory handed me back my phone and the four of them ordered their cones. My first cone of the year tasted especially good this year. It really pays to be a top detective sometimes."
