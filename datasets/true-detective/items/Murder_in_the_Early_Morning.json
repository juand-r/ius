      "content": "Melody Kairns was usually the first person out of bed in the mornings. However, on this cool, spring morning in Oklahoma, she was still in bed at nine. All others in the Kairns household slept late that day, so they would say, and did not notice Melody’s absence from the kitchen until Nancy, the last person to arise, voiced her concern. It fell to Vernon, Melody’s husband of twenty-four years, to return to the bedroom and check on his wife. He found Melody, a handsome woman of forty-four years, dead and mostly unmarked. The only noticeable evidence of foul play was a small, round head wound near her temple, crusted over with a small amount of dried blood. She looked like she was peacefully asleep, which Vernon considered was quite unlike her, as she was usually a noisy, restless sleeper. Vernon, before allowing himself to go into panic, felt her cold wrist. There was no pulse—it was evident she had been dead for several hours. The coroner would later say that she had been dead for approximately seven hours, placing the murder at sometime around two in the morning. Mercifully, the murder weapon, later discovered to be an ice pick, missing from the kitchen, killed her quickly. There was no blood on Melody’s body or bed sheets. But the case stumped the family and police. Several weeks passed, and spring gave way to a hot summer. Vernon invited his sister-in-law Constance, a widow who lived in Texas, to visit for the first time since her sister had been murdered. Constance had been vacationing, staying with the Kairns family, the week that her sister died. She was nearly inconsolable, and Vernon sent her home soon after Melody’s funeral. Constance had little use for Vernon, whom she suspected of womanizing and felt didn’t apply himself to his career and family as he should, but she appreciated the chance to see her niece and nephew again, her last connections to her sister. She and Melody had been close when they were children, even with a seven-year age difference. They had shared a bedroom in their family’s small, east Texas farmhouse when growing up, and also shared all of their hopes, dreams and secrets. Constance recalled those days with fondness but did not entirely miss them, for Melody suffered lifelong sinus trouble and snored loudly, making sound sleep impossible for her until the day she was murdered. That Constance had extremely sensitive hearing only made matters worse, as she, too, experienced lifelong sleeping problems. Still, they had been more than sisters; they were soul mates. Melody’s death had been extremely hard on her. The morning she arrived, just after breakfast, Vernon gathered all of the family into the spacious den. It was the first time since that horrible day they had all been together in one room. After a few minutes of awkward small talk, Vernon cleared his throat and stated, “One of us murdered Melody.” He could barely utter the words and hated what the children must be thinking and going through. But, the police were stumped by the case, and it was apparent that they would get nowhere in the investigation unless one of the family remembered a detail about the night they’d previously forgotten. Vernon explained that the police had encouraged him to bring them together to talk about Melody’s murder again, with Constance present this time. He was not really confident any of them would remember something previously overlooked, but wanted to give it a try. He then asked, “Did anyone see or hear anything out of the ordinary the night she died?” The Kairns house was a big two story and well insulated. Sound did not carry well in it and Vernon was not surprised when nobody replied in the affirmative. John said, “I came home around midnight; I had been out with friends. All the lights were out and I assumed everyone was in bed. I went to the den and watched TV. It must have been three or so before I went upstairs to bed.” Nancy offered, “I was on the phone in my room, with the door closed. Beth and I didn’t quit talking until two-thirty or so.” Nancy gave her father a guilty look, as she knew he disapproved of her late night calls with her talkative best friend Beth Jameson. Vernon then turned to Constance. Barely hiding his animosity, he asked, “And what about you?” Constance smiled thinly, and answered, “I went to bed before midnight and didn’t see or talk to anyone again until next morning. She paused, and then said to John, “I thought about coming downstairs to watch television with you, but I could tell that you were watching one of those Friday the 13th-type movies. You all know how I hate violence with guns and knives.” Turning to Vernon, she said, “I didn’t hear anything from your room all night long.” Constance and Vernon looked at each other. Icily, she asked, “So what about you?” Vernon replied, “I went to bed at eleven-thirty. I vaguely recall hearing John come in downstairs as I was drifting off to a deep sleep. That’s the last thing I remember before awaking the next morning.” He shook, and his voice cracked when saying, “I didn’t notice anything wrong when I got up. I’m always groggy before morning coffee.” Nancy asked her father, “You don’t really believe John or I killed Mom, do you? She nervously glanced at Constance and said, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to imply you killed Mom.” Nancy’s cheeks were rosy red from embarrassment. Constance answered, softly, “Don’t worry about it, dear. I know what you are going through.” Vernon appreciated his sister-in-law’s gentling handling of his troubled daughter, but that did not stop him from saying, “You are the only one who cannot account for your presence during the window of time Melody … left us.” He could not bring himself to use the word “murder” again. Constance thought a long moment, sadness washing over her as she looked at Vernon and Melody’s sweet children. Before speaking, she silently cursed, “Oh, how I hate it’s come to this!” But then she spoke, saying to all of them, “No, I cannot account for my time. I don’t have to because it doesn’t make any difference. The game is up.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Means/Murder weapon  \n   –  An ice-pick taken from the kitchen.  \n   –  Whoever used it had to enter Melody and Vernon’s bedroom without being noticed and be close enough to strike a single, accurate blow to her temple.\n\n2.  Opportunity / Where everybody really was at about 2 a.m. (time of death)  \n\n    • John (son) – says he was in the den watching television until after 3 a.m.  \n      Constance, who has extraordinarily sharp hearing, confirms she heard the television and the characteristic sounds of a horror film continuously until a little after 3.  \n      In a large, well-insulated two-storey house, anyone on the first floor would have had to climb the stairs, cross the landing, enter the master bedroom, kill Melody, return downstairs and resume the film – all without pausing the set or letting the volume change.  That is practically impossible.\n\n    • Nancy (daughter) – on the telephone with her friend Beth until about 2 : 30 a.m.  \n      That alibi can be checked instantly by Beth or the telephone company’s log.\n\n    • Constance – alone in the guest room; no corroboration.  \n      However, she is pathologically frightened of “guns and knives”, specifically of stabbing weapons, and has always avoided films that show them.  The murder was committed with a stabbing instrument.  That does not yet clear her, but it makes her a very unlikely user of exactly that kind of weapon.\n\n    • Vernon (husband) – claims he went to sleep at 11 : 30, “vaguely” heard John come in around midnight, then slept soundly until morning.\n\n3.  The crucial acoustic clue  \n    • Melody’s life-long, violent snoring was notorious.  Constance, who had shared a room with her for years, calls it “more noise than a freight train.”  \n    • Vernon says (a) the house is so well insulated that sounds do not carry, yet (b) as he was “drifting off” he could hear John coming in downstairs.  \n    • If the husband could notice the faint sound of a door downstairs through all that insulation, he could certainly notice the much louder, continuous snoring a few inches from his ear – and, more to the point, its sudden cessation.\n\n4.  Logical deduction  \n    • Melody was killed at about 2 a.m.  From that moment on she made no sound at all.  \n    • Anyone who had been sleeping next to her would inevitably have registered the abrupt silence after years of nightly, deafening snoring – unless that person already knew why the silence had begun.  \n    • Therefore the one person whose testimony is impossible to believe is the man who shared the bed and says he “noticed nothing unusual.”  \n    • He also had unrestricted physical access to the kitchen where the ice-pick was kept and to the bedroom where Melody lay.\n\n5.  Motive  \n    The story hints that Vernon was deeply unhappy in the marriage (“womanising”, “didn’t apply himself to career or family”) and had lived for twenty-four years with a partner whose snoring never allowed him an undisturbed night.  He was also the only family member whose financial future would be considerably eased by Melody’s death (insurance, sole ownership of the house, etc.).  Opportunity plus motive plus the impossible silence point directly and uniquely to him.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nVernon Kairns, John Kairns, Nancy Kairns, Constance (Kairns) ­— married name unknown\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nVernon Kairns\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nOn the night in question Vernon waited until the rest of the household seemed settled.  Shortly before 2 a.m. he went downstairs, took the kitchen ice-pick, returned to the bedroom and, while Melody lay on her side asleep, drove the pick into her temple.  The wound was small, produced little external bleeding, and death was immediate and quiet.  Vernon wiped the weapon, hid or disposed of it until morning, and got back into bed.  For the first time in years the room was silent; Vernon could at last sleep.  Around midnight he had indeed heard John come in, but by invoking that trivial detail next day he tried to prove he had drifted off early and slept through everything.  What he could not explain, and what ultimately gave him away, was how he could be conscious of a distant door downstairs yet oblivious to the sudden disappearance of the thunderous snoring inches from his ear.  That contradiction revealed he was awake, alert, and responsible for the silence.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• John Kairns – His continuous viewing of a loud slasher film until after 3 a.m. is confirmed by Constance’s super-sensitive hearing; he could not be both downstairs watching TV and upstairs committing murder.  \n\n• Nancy Kairns – Telephone records and her friend Beth will confirm she was on the line until 2 : 30 a.m., the heart of the murder window.  Talking in her room she could neither leave unnoticed nor wield an ice-pick.  \n\n• Constance – Although alone, she is terrified of stabbing weapons, has no motive benefiting from Melody’s death, and, most decisively, her own sensitive hearing would have registered any movement on the landing had she left her room.  Nothing of the sort was heard.  Moreover, her reasoning about the snoring establishes the internal contradiction in Vernon’s story, not her own guilt.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "The murderer sat, surprised and shocked, in the big easy chair. The family sat motionless, hanging on the Constance’s every word.\nShe continued, “I have been so depressed since the killing that I have not been able to think straight. But, after listening to everyone this morning, the blinders lifted.”\n“Melody died around two that terrible night; I should say, early morning.” Turning to John, she said, “You could not have killed your mother. Everyone here is aware that I hear better than most people, and I know you were watching television downstairs until a few minutes after three. You could not have been downstairs watching television and upstairs committing murder at the same time.”\nNancy was agitated and near tears, so Constance addressed her next. “It wasn’t you either, sweetheart. It will be easy enough for your friend Beth, and the telephone company, if need be, to verify you were talking on the telephone. I’m certain you would not have heard or paid any attention to unfamiliar noises when deep into conversation with Beth.” The speaker offered a warm, comforting smile and this settled Nancy back into a stony, but calm, silence.\nConstance turned and addressed Vernon. “Remember I said I do not have to account for my time because it doesn’t make any difference?” Vernon, in shock, barely nodded, but he understood what was being said. Constance continued, “That I was in my room alone all night with nobody to confirm it doesn’t make any difference because I know you killed Melody.” Pausing, she said, “I should say; you and the children are well aware of my fear of guns and knives.” Her voice began to break but she continued, “Do you really think I would kill my sister with an ice pick?” Staring intensely at him she went on, “You forgot that we grew up and slept in the same bedroom. Melody never had a sound night’s sleep in her life and makes more noise than a freight train.”\nVernon replied, weakly, “So what?”\nConstance could not bear to look at him any longer. “Do you really expect me to believe that you were alert enough to hear your son come in downstairs, in a house that does not carry sounds well, but you noticed nothing unusual with the restless sleeper lying right beside you all night long?”"
