      "content": "Five -year- old Andy, (5 1/2, as he would tell you), came to his father early one evening and said, “Matthew is hiding. Can you tell where he is Dad knew that the boys liked to play games with him and their mother. He also knew that Andy expected some questions. He started by asking, “I suppose you know where he is?” Andy, who expressed himself quite well for a five year old, replied, “Yes, I’ve been with him all afternoon. I know where he is but we want you to find him.” “OK. Tell me where you’ve been.” Andy started speaking hurriedly, causing Dad to have to remind him to slow down. Andy started again, forcing himself to speak more slowly. “Well, we’ve been in Matthew’s room, my room, the garage, the tree house and the hall closet.” Andy grinned, laughed, and said, “I bet you can’t find him!” Dad chuckled. This wouldn’t be too hard. At least, he did not think it would be. Three-year-old Matthew had an advanced way of losing things – and himself! Dad took a long look at his oldest son, as he often did. There were grass stains on his feet and the remnants of a chocolate bar around his lips. A typical five year old, he thought, before saying, “OK, but after we find him, you need a bath!” Almost shouting, Andy pleaded, “Tell me where he is!” Dad answered, “First, let’s takes a look around The first thing they inspected was the hall closet. The hall closet was right off of the entrance to the den. Dad had seen them open the closet door and shut it earlier in the afternoon before they headed upstairs. Next, they went upstairs to Andy’s room. There was a big water spill right at the entrance. Andy had brought an uncovered glass of water upstairs against his mother’s wishes earlier that morning and dropped it when opening the door to his room. Dad noticed with irritation the puddle was just as he had seen it several hours ago as nobody had bothered to wipe up the puddle. Andy was grinning and giggling. He was certain he and his little brother were putting one over on Dad. Dad said nothing but motioned for them to journey next to Matthew’s room. Matthew’s room was unusual. The closet was directly opposite the room entrance and had no door. The slide doors had been removed long ago and one could easily see everything in the closet. Looking over at Matthew’s crib bed, he realized he and Mom were going to have to get him a “big boy” bed soon. Mom was going to have to find another place to store the short pile of books, which were underneath the crib. Interestingly enough, the room had no other furniture. Dad and Mom could and, usually, did inventory everything in the room just by a quick scan from the hall when something of Matthew’s was missing, which was often. Next, Dad and Andy went outside to survey the tree house, which sat in the middle of the large back yard. Dad frowned as he remembered that Mom had chided him for watering the yard earlier. Now, he couldn’t mow until tomorrow. He looked down and saw his shoes were damp from the still wet grass. He silently berated himself for wearing his new house shoes outside. He could already see a green tinge on one of them. Finally, they went to the garage, departing through the kitchen. Andy was a little hesitant to go there. He knew Dad and Mom got mad if he or Matthew went to the garage without one of them, although that did not stop either of them from doing it occasionally. Not only did Dad have a room full of tools and chemicals that were not kid friendly, but the garage floor had many years of grime on it. Invariably, when Matthew or Andy would venture there alone, they would track oily grime onto the kitchen floor upon returning back into the house. Dad looked around for a moment and said, “OK, Andy, let’s go back into the house.” Back in the den, Andy became excited again, asking, “Where is he, where is he?” Dad grinned and said, gently, “I know where he is. Let’s go get him.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThis is not a murder or theft inquiry, it is a little-boy “whodunit” (really a “where-is-he” game).  \nThe only “crime” to be solved is: Who is responsible for the present mystery—i.e. who is doing the hiding and where?\n\n1. Motive  \n   • Andy’s motive is simply to play a trick on Dad.  \n   • Matthew’s motive is to be the one who actually hides.  \n   • The adults have no motive that relates to the puzzle.\n\n2. Opportunity  \n   • Only Matthew could have slipped into a hiding place after the two brothers visited all the rooms.  \n   • Andy has been in full view of Dad the entire time once the search began, so he cannot be the one hidden.\n\n3. Physical evidence / alibis  \n   • Hall closet – Dad saw both boys slam the door and then go upstairs. That rules it out.  \n   • Andy’s room – A large puddle of water is still undisturbed, showing no one walked through it.  \n   • Matthew’s room – Completely visible from the hall; no one there.  \n   • Garage – No oily grime on either boy’s feet, so they have not been in there today.  \n   • Outside / tree house – The grass that surrounds the tree is wet; Andy’s bare feet are grass-stained. Therefore both boys were out there this afternoon. If Matthew were still outside anywhere else (yard, bushes) Dad would have seen him while walking to the tree house. The most logical hiding spot reached from the grass but not openly visible is the elevated tree-house platform.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   Eliminate every location that the physical evidence rules out; the only location left is the tree house.  \n   Therefore Matthew must be up in the tree house, making him the “culprit”—the one who is missing and needs to be “found.”\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMatthew, Andy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMatthew\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarlier in the afternoon the two brothers wandered through every place Andy later listed: the hall closet, Andy’s room (where Andy dropped the forbidden glass of water), Matthew’s room, the tree house, and the garage entrance.  \nFinally Andy helped Matthew climb the ladder into the tree house, then came in to challenge Dad.  \nDuring the search Dad noticed:  \n• No water had been tracked through Andy’s doorway.  \n• No oily grime was on either boy’s feet.  \n• Grass stains were plainly visible on Andy’s feet.  \nThe stains could only come from the freshly watered, still-wet lawn that leads to the tree house.  \nEliminating the other four locations left only the tree house.  \nDad and Andy then went outside, climbed up, and retrieved a giggling, grass-stained Matthew from his hiding place.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAndy cannot be the hidden youngster because he was with Dad the whole time guiding the search.  \nMom and Dad were never out of one another’s sight in the relevant interval and have no reason even to join in the game.  \nTherefore none of them could be the “culprit.” The only person who was ever unaccounted for—and who had the motive to hide—was Matthew.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
