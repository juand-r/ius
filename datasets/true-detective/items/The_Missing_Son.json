      "content": "As Amanda fixed breakfast for her four sons, she thought this Wednesday morning in May was truly a gift from God. It was already warm with bright sunshine and no clouds in the sky. But Amanda knew the boys were tired. She felt sorry for her husband Warren this morning. He had left early to spend the day with his father, as last night his mother had passed away. The family had been notified of her heart attack just after dinner, and they spent the rest of the evening at the hospital. Amanda was grateful they all had the opportunity to say goodbye to her before she slipped into quiet sleep. They arrived home late. “No wonder the boys look fatigued”, she thought. “It’s been a trying time for us all.” Amanda looked affectionately at her four boys as they hurriedly ate breakfast. Connor, at eighteen, was the oldest. He was what she called her feisty one. Until Coach Hastings at Upstate College had offered him a full athletic scholarship for next year, Connor had been lackadaisical in study habits and class attendance. Hastings was known as a no-nonsense coach who demanded the same effort in the classroom as he did on the football field. He also expected good citizenship from his players and those who could not stay out of trouble off the field needn’t worry about spending any time on it. Amanda had been pleased with the dramatic turnaround in her oldest son this year; Connor was doing everything he could to please both Coach Hastings and the faculty at Lee School. Caleb, sixteen years old, was her studious son. He was just finishing his sophomore year at Lee School and had maintained a perfect 4.0 grade average since commencing middle school. Caleb hoped to be a research scientist someday and possessed the analytical and perfectionist attitude that persons in that field must have to succeed. Amanda often worried about his over-developed sense of perfection as there had been times Caleb had overworked himself to his own detriment. Caleb would literally do anything to succeed. Caleb looked worried this morning, but, didn’t he always? Amanda hoped that his first hour gym class would perk him up—Wednesday tended to be a pop quiz day. Amanda considered Jordan, age fourteen. Jordan did not enjoy the robust health her other sons did. Jordan suffered from Hypoglycemia and it was no minor ailment with him, as he had been known to pass out at unexpected times. Amanda prayed that he would one day grow out of this. However, she took comfort in the fact that Jordan usually took pretty good care of himself. He watched carefully what he ate and drank, and monitored his exercise closely. Still, he could get dizzy and lightheaded at the oddest of times, especially when he overdid it. There had been several occasions in which the school nurse called, saying he arrived at school feeling weak and faint. The youngest was Kyle. Kyle was twelve and in his first year at Lee. Kyle was her current “problem” child. He was experiencing attention span problems and not doing too well in school. However, while Kyle was currently getting poor grades, he wasn’t a troublemaker—he had a healthy desire to get along with his teachers and the vice principal. Amanda wryly wished he had the same desire to get along with his report card. Her husband, Warren, had been like that when Kyle’s age, so she hoped it would not be a long term problem. Amanda continued to think of Kyle. Lee School was a place where an uninterested student could fail quickly. Pop quizzes, which were given frequently—usually either on Monday or Wednesday and often, both—carried as much weight as Friday tests and semester exams. This was of many reasons that Lee was the top school in the state, academically speaking. Amanda considered it fortunate that Lee was both a middle and high school. It was even better that the school was scarcely half a mile down the block from their home. Unless the weather was severely wet or cold, the boys walked together the short distance to school. She liked the fact that the path was well traveled, as many neighborhood children walked to school past their house. It was also well patrolled, as there were crossing guards at two key intersections, plus a police squad car that sat in the parking lot of the Elizabeth Toland Branch Library in the mornings and afternoons, monitoring both the behavior of the children and the street traffic. Amanda put all of her thoughts and cares behind her as she kissed each son goodbye. She watched them walk briskly down the sidewalk until out of sight. Stepping back into the house, she thought again, What a pretty day. During the middle of the morning, the telephone rang. It was Marge Schroeder, the Lee School receptionist. Marge knew Amanda well from Connor’s time as a habitual occupant of the vice principal’s office. She said, “Good morning, Amanda. One of your sons did not make it to first hour. We don’t know where he is” Amanda thought for a moment. Finally, she said to Marge, “I know who it was without you having to say. I’ll see you in a minute.” She told Marge who she suspected had skipped class and, before the startled Marge could answer, Amanda hung up and headed out the door.",

After a session in Vice Principal Kedd’s office, Amanda stopped by the desk to visit with Marge before heading home. Amanda took time to explain the news about her mother-in-law before Marge asked, \"How did you know it wasn’t Connor?\"\nAmanda replied, “Connor is too interested in his football scholarship next year to be cutting class. Coach Hastings simply will not tolerate it. Coach has done something Warren and I were not able to do: he put the fear of God into him and made Connor into a good student and decent citizen. Believe me, Connor is the last of my sons to not show up for class now.”\nAmanda paused, thinking Marge would say something. However, Marge remained silent, eager to hear more of her friend’s discourse. So, Amanda continued, “It wasn’t Kyle, even though you would think he would be the logical one to cut class at this point. Kyle would no doubt skip school just as his older brother did, but like Connor now he has a healthy respect for Mr. Kedd and the faculty. He won’t apply himself scholastically for them, but doesn’t want to be in disciplinary trouble with them either. Warren was like that at twelve and grew out of it, or so he says. Kyle is a good kid. I believe he will.”\nMarge asked, “What about Jordan? He’s fainted before in school.”\n“Yes, and I would worry about him walking to school if the route wasn’t so well traveled. His brothers are normally with him and, even on those occasions he walks alone, there are plenty of people around him. I knew Jordan would be in the nurse’s office if he had felt light-headed or had fainted after arriving here—and that was for sure a possibility as we are all tired from last night.\n“The last one of your brood I would ever think would cut class would be Caleb,” Marge said, a bit wistfully. “He’s normally such a good student. To think that we found him in the janitor’s closet—studying!”\n“Yes, he is a good student, but he has an unhealthy perfectionist streak. He was worried about a pop quiz. He was bound to have at least one today, perhaps more. He knew he wouldn’t have one in first hour gym so he decided to hide out and study, then lost track of the time. We were busy with Warren’s family last night and he didn’t have time to prepare for today. He was worried to death, which is why Mr. Kedd is excusing it this time with a stern lecture.”\nMarge chuckled. She would be grateful and quite surprised if one of her own sons became overzealous concerning grades. Then, she remembered the reason for Caleb’s odd behavior. Softly, she said, “I’m so sorry about Warren’s mother.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Identify exactly what “crime” we are dealing with.  \n    – The school phones to say one of Amanda’s four sons never arrived in his 1st-hour class.  \n    – So the “culprit” is simply the boy who cut (or appeared to cut) class.\n\n2.  List the four possible offenders and note everything the narration tells us about each:  \n    a) Connor (18) – was once a slacker but now has a full-ride football scholarship dependent on perfect attendance, good grades and good citizenship. Coach Hastings is “no-nonsense” and would bench (or drop) him instantly for a single skip.  \n    b) Caleb (16) – straight-A perfectionist, terrified of doing less than perfect, will “literally do anything to succeed.” Has 1st-hour gym, which never gives pop quizzes, but Wednesday is the prime pop-quiz day for academic classes that follow. He went to bed late and had no time to study last night because the whole family was at the hospital.  \n    c) Jordan (14) – hypoglycemic, occasionally faints. If he felt weak he habitually reports to the school nurse; the nurse always calls Amanda at once. No such call came.  \n    d) Kyle (12) – currently earning poor grades, but is not a trouble-maker; he “has a healthy desire to get along with his teachers and the vice-principal” and therefore avoids discipline problems even though his marks are low.\n\n3.  Analyse motive, opportunity, and likely behaviour.  \n    – Connor: tremendous motive NOT to skip (scholarship). Opportunity exists, but risk is huge and completely out of character now.  \n    – Kyle: weakest academic record, so in theory he might skip, but his main motive is to avoid disciplinary trouble; simply being absent first period would push him directly into trouble with Vice-Principal Kedd.  \n    – Jordan: could be missing if he fainted en route, but the route is densely travelled and patrolled; if he collapsed someone would obtain help and the nurse would already have phoned.  \n    – Caleb: strongest motive TO skip the first period. Because (i) first-hour gym will not test him; (ii) the rest of Wednesday is full of dreaded pop quizzes; (iii) he had no time to study after the grandmother’s death; (iv) his perfectionism makes him desperate for every extra minute of study. Hiding in a janitor’s closet would give him uninterrupted time, and a perfectionist in panic could easily lose track of the clock.\n\n4.  Physical evidence / outcome supplied in the text:  \n    – After the search, the missing boy is located “in the janitor’s closet — studying!”  \n    – Vice-Principal Kedd gives him only “a stern lecture” and excuses it this time. (If it were Kyle or Connor, both with prior discipline histories, it would not have been treated so leniently.)  \n    – Amanda herself tells Marge that the son was worried about pop quizzes, had first-hour gym, hid to study, and “lost track of the time.” Those facts match only Caleb.\n\n5.  Logical deduction: all clues converge on Caleb; every stated reason Amanda gives for ruling the other boys out is sound and no contradicting clue exists.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nConnor, Caleb, Jordan, Kyle\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCaleb\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nBecause the family stayed at the hospital the previous night after their grandmother’s fatal heart attack, Caleb had no opportunity to study for the usual mid-week pop quizzes.  \nKnowing that his first-hour class was only gym, Caleb decided he could gain a critical extra fifty minutes of study time if he avoided roll call. On the walk to school he let his brothers go ahead, slipped into an unlocked janitor’s closet near the gym, and buried himself in his books. Absorbed in last-minute revision, he completely lost track of the bell.  \nWhen first-hour attendance was taken, he was marked absent; the office called his mother. Meanwhile teachers began searching the building; Vice-Principal Kedd finally opened the supply closet and discovered Caleb sitting on an overturned bucket with textbook, notebook and pen in hand. After being escorted to the office, Caleb explained his motives. Because of his spotless record and the extraordinary circumstances of the previous night, Mr. Kedd issued only a reprimand and sent him on to second period.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nConnor – Skipping would jeopardise the full athletic scholarship Coach Hastings has promised him. His recent “dramatic turnaround” and fear of the coach make truancy virtually impossible.  \nKyle – Though academically indifferent, he dislikes disciplinary trouble; cutting first period would place him squarely in Vice-Principal Kedd’s sights, something he works hard to avoid.  \nJordan – If he had felt faint he would have gone straight to the nurse, who would have telephoned Amanda at once; no such call occurred. Furthermore, other pupils, crossing-guards or the police officer on patrol would have noticed if he had collapsed on the short, busy route to school.  \nOnly Caleb had both a powerful motive (perfectionist terror of pop quizzes for which he had not studied) and an unobstructed opportunity (gym class that takes no written attendance at a desk) and was in fact discovered where a desperate student would hide to study. Therefore Caleb — and only Caleb — is the “culprit.”\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "It had taken awhile to find the missing son, but find him they did. After a session in Vice Principal Kedd’s office, Amanda stopped by the desk to visit with Marge before heading home. Amanda took time to explain the news about her mother-in-law before Marge asked, \"How did you know it wasn’t Connor?\"\nAmanda replied, “Connor is too interested in his football scholarship next year to be cutting class. Coach Hastings simply will not tolerate it. Coach has done something Warren and I were not able to do: he put the fear of God into him and made Connor into a good student and decent citizen. Believe me, Connor is the last of my sons to not show up for class now.”\nAmanda paused, thinking Marge would say something. However, Marge remained silent, eager to hear more of her friend’s discourse. So, Amanda continued, “It wasn’t Kyle, even though you would think he would be the logical one to cut class at this point. Kyle would no doubt skip school just as his older brother did, but like Connor now he has a healthy respect for Mr. Kedd and the faculty. He won’t apply himself scholastically for them, but doesn’t want to be in disciplinary trouble with them either. Warren was like that at twelve and grew out of it, or so he says. Kyle is a good kid. I believe he will.”\nMarge asked, “What about Jordan? He’s fainted before in school.”\n“Yes, and I would worry about him walking to school if the route wasn’t so well traveled. His brothers are normally with him and, even on those occasions he walks alone, there are plenty of people around him. I knew Jordan would be in the nurse’s office if he had felt light-headed or had fainted after arriving here—and that was for sure a possibility as we are all tired from last night.\n“The last one of your brood I would ever think would cut class would be Caleb,” Marge said, a bit wistfully. “He’s normally such a good student. To think that we found him in the janitor’s closet—studying!”\n“Yes, he is a good student, but he has an unhealthy perfectionist streak. He was worried about a pop quiz. He was bound to have at least one today, perhaps more. He knew he wouldn’t have one in first hour gym so he decided to hide out and study, then lost track of the time. We were busy with Warren’s family last night and he didn’t have time to prepare for today. He was worried to death, which is why Mr. Kedd is excusing it this time with a stern lecture.”\nMarge chuckled. She would be grateful and quite surprised if one of her own sons became overzealous concerning grades. Then, she remembered the reason for Caleb’s odd behavior. Softly, she said, “I’m so sorry about Warren’s mother.”"
