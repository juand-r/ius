      "content": "Leon Adams clocked in a few minutes before 10:00 a.m. on a very mild and sunny Tuesday in April, as he was supposed to. It took only a few minutes to open the cash registers in the men’s department. Leon was a suit salesman and he knew from experience that the first couple of hours on a weekday would be very slow. Slow to the point of boredom. So, he was surprised when customers began to show up shortly after opening. The first to arrive was Ed Puckett, (Leon would introduce himself to all of the morning customers and learn their names). Leon greeted Ed as he entered the men’s area. Ed looked around and picked out a few suits to try on in the fitting room. Ed had not been back there long when Leon’s second customer, Louis Murphy, showed up at the cash register asking about a good deal on a sport coat and pair of slacks. Leon helped Louis in finding them and led him back to the fitting room. Meanwhile, Ed was still in the dressing room. Leon was pleased that he had two customers in his area so early -- it was only 10:20. Leon spotted Gene Roberts browsing the edge of the men’s area at 10:25, just after noticing that Ed had left the dressing room. What a busy day! It was difficult to keep track of so many customers. Leon could see Ed wandering in the shoe department, so he moved on to his next sale, greeting Gene and escorting him to the dress shirt table, all the while Louis examined himself in the fitting room’s full length mirror. He hoped Louis would like the sport coat and slacks he was trying on. Although he was some distance away from him, the garments appeared to be a good fit. Justin Tanner came in at 10:30 and asked Leon where the men’s sweaters were. Leon walked Justin over to the sweater table. Justin thanked him and said he wanted to pick one out to try on in the fitting room. As Justin was browsing the sweaters, Leon decided to check on Louis. As he walked back toward the fitting room, he saw Louis walk away from the mirror and return to his dressing room. It was only 10:36 and Leon was having an uncharacteristically busy weekday. At 10:45, Leon saw Justin enter the fitting room with a green sweater and Leon noticed that Louis was still in his dressing room. At 10:50 George Whitley walked over to Leon from the shoe department and asked about a catalog order. Leon placed the order for him at the cash register, but it took a few minutes and he did not finish with it until after 11:00. George paid for the order, which was a pair of dress slacks, and left. At 11:04, Leon noticed Justin leaving the men’s department. He had not purchased the sweater. At 11:10, Leon knew that Louis had never left his dressing room and went to check on him. When he found him, he received the shock of his life. Louis was dead on the floor with a knife wound in his heart. Blood covered the carpeting of the small fitting room. Mercifully, there were now no customers in the men’s department as Gene Roberts had left without trying anything on. Leon held on to his composure long enough to return to the cashier station and call the store security officer, Ronald Clay. Leon’s mouth was hot and dry as Ronald answered his phone, saying simply, “Clay speaking.” Leon stammered, “Ron, get over to the suit fitting room. A customer has been murdered.” Ronald was the retired detective Lieutenant Ronald Clay of the city police department. He came to work at the store after retiring from a 25-year career as a law enforcement officer. There wasn’t much that went on in the store that escaped his attention. Leon was grateful he was on duty and available to handle this nightmare. Clay quickly found the shocked Leon still standing at the cash register. Firmly, but gently, Ronald had Leon lead him to the deceased customer. As soon as Clay saw him he knew who it was. He said, “I know this guy. He’s Louis Murphy. I dealt with him and his friends quite a bit when I was on the Force. He’s known as ‘Louie the Lip’ and is a career mobster.” Weakly, Leon asked, “So you think another crook got to him?” “Yeah,’ Ron replied. “It’s too much of a coincidence for it not to be mob related.” Dryly, he added, “I’ve never seen a person murdered in a department store dressing room before, and I’ve seen a lot.” Within minutes, the store closed and a dozen police officers appeared on the scene. Clay knew that the key to solving the murder quickly rested with Leon, who always knew where men’s department customers were at any given time. Ronald led him back to his office for a quiet visit. He wanted to speak with him before his former associates did. After determining Leon was recovered sufficiently from the shock, he asked him to relate all of the morning’s activities he could remember. Leon remembered everything and relayed the activities and movements of the five customers in detail. Clay listened intently. After considering what he had been told, they went to the video room and reviewed the security tapes. After watching it a couple of times, Ronald told Leon, “This is the murderer.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Fix the exact interval in which Louis Murphy could have been killed.\n   • Leon last ​saw Louis alive, standing at the mirror, at 10:36.  \n   • The body is found at 11:10.  \n   Therefore the murder took place between 10:36 and 11:10.\n\n2. Check who was physically able to enter the fitting-room area during that interval.\n   • Ed Puckett – out of the fitting rooms by 10:25 and watched wandering around the shoe department at 10:25.  Leon never again loses sight of Ed long enough for him to re-enter the booths unnoticed, and the tapes confirm it.\n   • Gene Roberts – browsed shirts, never entered the fitting rooms (seen on tape).\n   • Justin Tanner – entered the fitting rooms at 10:45 and remained there until 11:04.\n   • “George Whitley” – first appears at 10:50 coming out of the shoe department, not from an entrance.  Before 10:50 the cameras do not show him anywhere in the store.\n   • Leon Adams – continuously waited on customers in full view of the cameras.\n   • Security officer Ronald Clay – supposedly in his office, but he is missing from every camera between 10:30 and about 11:05, and no employee can say they saw him on the floor.\n\n3. Look for signs that point to the murderer.\n   • The killer had to get close enough to stab Louis in the heart; he would very likely pick up blood.  \n   • “George” orders a pair of dress slacks immediately after the probable time of the murder.  Why would a walk-in customer order trousers that would not be delivered that day?  The simplest answer: the trousers he had just been wearing were now unusable.\n   • “George” is on camera only after the approximate time of death and vanishes from the building at 11:00 – yet, miraculously, a few minutes later Ronald Clay is answering the telephone in a clean security uniform.\n   • Clay eliminates “George” as a suspect at once, although the only evidence against the others comes from the security tapes – tapes Clay alone controls and could edit in minutes.\n   • Clay immediately recognises both Louis and Justin as long-time underworld figures.  If Justin Tanner had seen the ex-detective who had chased him for years working as store security, he would almost certainly have walked right back out of the store.  The fact that he stayed proves he never saw Clay – because Clay was on the sales floor disguised as someone else.\n\n4. Motive\n   Clay himself supplies it: twenty years of frustration trying to “nail both of those guys.”  Retirement gave him neither justice nor satisfaction.  When he unexpectedly found Louis Murphy in an almost deserted fitting-room area, he seized the opportunity, murdered him, and then tried to frame Louis’s rival, Justin Tanner.\n\n5. Reconstruction that fits every fact:\n   • Clay removes his uniform, puts on civilian clothing, and becomes “George Whitley.”\n   • Between 10:36 and 10:45, while Leon is busy at the sweater table, “George” slips into Louis’s booth and stabs him.\n   • He wipes the knife, stuffs his blood-spattered slacks in a bag, and strolls into the shoe department.\n   • At 10:50 he walks over to Leon, orders a new pair of trousers (to replace the ruined ones) and deliberately keeps Leon occupied until after 11:00 to cement his alibi.\n   • He leaves the sales floor, changes back into his uniform, hides the weapon and bloody clothing, and is in his office to answer Leon’s call at 11:10.\n   • Controlling the tapes, he erases the scenes that show him entering the dressing rooms and calmly blames the only remaining “possible” killer, Justin Tanner.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEd Puckett, Gene Roberts, Justin “Jersey Jim” Tanner, “George Whitley”, Leon Adams, Ronald Clay\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nRonald “Ron” Clay — alias “George Whitley”\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nShortly after 10:30, Security Officer Ronald Clay notices the old mobster Louis “Louie the Lip” Murphy heading for the fitting rooms.  Still burning from years of failure to put Murphy behind bars, Clay decides to administer his own brand of justice.\n\nHe slips off the floor, swaps his uniform for ordinary clothing kept in his office and dons a cap and glasses.  Disguised, he walks into the men’s department from an employees’ corridor that joins the shoe department, unnoticed by the cameras that look only at public entrances.\n\nAt about 10:40 he watches Leon escort another customer away, then slips into Louis’s cubicle and drives a knife into his heart.  He wipes the knife, stuffs it and his blood-spattered trousers into a plastic bag, locks Louis’s door from the inside and pulls it shut behind him.\n\nClay cannot re-appear as a guard covered in blood, so he keeps Leon busy: at 10:50 he strolls from the shoe department to the register as “George Whitley,” ordering a pair of dress slacks to replace the ones he has just ruined.  The transaction occupies Leon until after 11:00.\n\n“George” then leaves the sales floor, enters a staff area, discards the weapon and bloody clothes, and changes back into his security uniform.  At 11:10, when Leon discovers the body and telephones for help, Clay is back in his office to answer the call.\n\nHe escorts Leon to the crime scene, reviews the video system he alone controls, deletes any incriminating footage, and declares that the only remaining person who could have killed Louis is Justin Tanner – a convenient enemy of the victim.\n\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Ed Puckett was seen on camera and by Leon wandering the shoe department from 10:25 onward; he never went near the fitting rooms again.  \n• Gene Roberts never entered the fitting-room area at all; both eyewitness testimony and the cameras agree.  \n• Justin Tanner did enter the fitting rooms, but he left without a speck of blood on him.  A close-range knife thrust that produced “blood covering the carpeting” would have splattered his clothing – yet Leon saw none.  The only reason to suspect Justin comes from Clay’s uncorroborated assertion that the two mobsters were enemies.  \n• “George Whitley” is not an independent customer at all; he is Clay in disguise.  \n• Leon Adams was continuously in front of customers and cameras except for the few seconds it took to walk between racks; he had neither the time nor the freedom from observation required to commit the murder.\n\nThus every fact – motive, means, opportunity, and the suspicious order for replacement trousers – converges on one man: Ronald Clay.  The veteran detective finally got his two-decade revenge, but only by becoming the criminal himself.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "Leon had suffered much in less than half a day. He asked, simply, “How do you know?\nRon clay answered, “We know it was not Ed Puckett. You saw Louie alive after Ed left the dressing room and wandered into the shoe department. It wasn’t George Whitley, either, because he came straight to you from the shoe department, placed his order at the cash register, and left. The same goes for Gene Roberts, as you said he never entered the fitting area.” Pausing for a moment, he added, “The videotapes confirm everything you have told me.”\nLeon was keenly interested in Ron Clay’s words. He asked, “So, you think it was Justin Tanner that killed Louie?”\n“Yes, and not only because he was the only one who could have done it. I recognize him. He is also known as “Jersey Jim” Tanner and a sworn enemy of “Louie the Lip.” No doubt he saw him back in the fitting area and seized the opportunity. Not a smart thing to do but those guys are not known for being bright.”\nRon paused to let this soak in. With a thin smile, he added, “You know, I spent over 20 years trying to nail both of those guys. If they had known I was the security officer here, I would never have seen either of them again.”"
