      "content": "“Say what you will about the Straw Hat circuit,” Arthur Glendon observed, “it does get us out of New York for the hot summer.” He waved a hand around, taking in the Straw Hat Theater, with its inviting lodge and Summer Theater, a hillside picture book Vermont setting. Janice Starling smiled. “Oh, I don’t know, Summer Theater is rather fun, and all that, I’ll agree, but we’re all hoping for something new, something to take us back to Broadway.” “As if you had ever been there, except for buying a ticket as a member of the audience for one of my plays,” Alice Cartwright said. “But Janice does have a point. New York is where the best opportunities are in the theater. Frankly, when I’m not in the city” - she said the word as though only one city existed in the world - “I just can’t wait to get back. Anyway, Arthur, what play are you casting for? I assume from your message on my cell phone, and the presence of these ladies that you have something specific in mind.” “No need to get over dramatic, dear,” interjected Sandra Buckingham, seated on the most comfortable chair in the room, which she had chosen as her entitlement. “It won’t help you get the part, whatever Arthur has in mind.” “Thank heavens I only asked the three of you!” Arthur thought. What he actually said was quite different. “We’re doing a new play, a comedy, “All’s Right, Now That You’re Here”. There is a wonderful female romantic lead, Rosemary. She’s full of fun and deviltry.” He paused for effect. “Surely one of you at least will fit the part perfectly. I have the scripts for you here. Take them back to the lodge. I’ll hear tryouts tomorrow morning at ten. Then we’ll really get down to business, with excerpts from the play. You - I mean for rehearsal, and then the lead actually selected - will be reading opposite Rex Lansford. I’ll be picking him up later tonight at the airport.” That was Arthur Glendon’s moment, and he had played it to the hilt. The three women gasped. Nobody had expected to find, in this rural corner of Vermont, that Rex Lansford would be playing in Summer Theater. Lansford, they all knew, had just last week celebrated the opening of his latest film, a summer blockbuster that was earning more than Steven Spielberg’s latest. Each woman knew that playing opposite Hollywood’s most bankable leading man could launch a career, or jump-start a stalled one. Janice Starling, Sandra Buckingham and Alice Cartwright each swore that she would get that part - nothing would stand in the way of that happening. They took their scripts and melted away to the lodge. The actresses came to the realization at just about the same time. The play’s story was about an actress who got her big break by making sure that the competition for the part was unable to try out. It all seemed rather amateurish, a laxative substituted for a chocolate bar, a misleading phone message that the tryout was rescheduled, that sort of thing. It was an updated, “All About Eve” with an edge. But it was also a broad comedy, played strictly for laughs, and the part absolutely sparkled. Played opposite Rex Lansford, who knew where it might lead? And just what did Arthur Glendon have in mind, anyway? Didn’t he know how nervous he was making them? Was life supposed to imitate art, or the other way around? Three guards went up, and the three actresses each made plans to secure the part. The more they read the play, the more the part sparkled, and the more they suspected each other. They each came to dinner and sat at separate tables, glowering across the dining room. Nobody was going to slip a laxative past them! The evening was devoted to rehearsal preparation, each in her own room. It went on and on. In the wee hours of the morning, Sandra Buckingham talked so loudly that Alice Cartwright, who had the room just beneath Sandra’s, pounded on the ceiling with a stick to quiet her rival. The noise stopped. “Well, she’s really there after all,” Alice thought. “We’ll see about her in the morning!” Janice Starling, who had the room next to Alice Cartwright, yawned in exhaustion. She decided not to go to breakfast in the morning. She asked the front desk for a wake up call, then took a sleeping pill and went back to bed. Promptly at ten o’clock the following morning, Alice and Sandra were on the set, ready for the casting call. Arthur was first on the set as usual. He frowned, but refused the suggestion that someone be sent to remind the missing Janice Starling that she was overdue for the tryout. “Pass me some of that hot lemonade, will you dearie?” Sandra said to Alice. Alice poured a mug of hot lemonade from the rolling snack bar just off the set. It was Sandra’s habit during rehearsals - so ingrained that directors made fun of the “hot lemonade” clause in her contracts. She wanted to clear her throat before going on stage. Sandra got just half way through her prepared monologue when she gasped and grabbed her throat. “What’s going on!” she managed to say, in between coughs ... “Somebody sabotaged this drink. It’s got vinegar in it!” She glared at Alice and tried wildly to find something to clear her vocal cords. Finally, she sat down and stared at Glendon. “Give me some time to get over this,” she said. “Of course, dear,” Glendon replied, in his very best butter-wouldn’t-melt tone of voice. He made a call with his cell phone, and then motioned to Alice Cartwright to begin her presentation. She started her monologue, but at that moment, Rex Lansford came onto the set. Glendon waved at Alice to continue, but with Lansford as a surprised witness, he and Sandra spent the next twenty minutes telling each other loud, boisterous stories. From onstage, Alice Cartwright looked at them first pleadingly, then in an imperious way, every inch Mary Queen of Scots faced with her persecutors. Then Janice Starling entered the set, out of breath, dress barely arranged, embarrassed, and full of apologies. “I left a wakeup call, but they never called me until just a few minutes ago,” she said. The excuse sounded lame, and her voice began to lose confidence. Arthur Glendon made a great show of looking at his watch. Janice glared at him and broke into her monologue. It was brilliantly performed. She smiled and left the stage. “Not so fast,” Alice said. “If you two are now ready to listen, I’m ready to perform.” Her monologue was flawless. Sandra had cleared her throat at last. She had spent the evening memorizing Rosemary’s key speech at the end of Act Two. It was so well done, that even her competitors applauded. Then Rex Lansford spoke to the three women. “You are all fine actresses, and Rosemary is a special part, somewhat devilish, I think Arthur told you. Just think what she would have done to get her part.” Then a light seemed to dawn, and the veteran star added, “I know what happened, and who is responsible for this very odd and untraditional tryout.”",

          "reveal_text": "Arthur Glendon sabotaged the tryouts, or tried to, to see if any of the actresses would react with a finer performance, as the leading character in the play, Rosemary, would have reacted. After their nervous rehearsals the night before, Alice and Sandra were his unwitting accomplices. Alice handed Sandra the vinegar-laced lemonade, but only Glendon could have known Sandra’s habit and also, as first on the set, could have had the opportunity of putting vinegar into the flask that contained her drink.\nAfter that, it was natural for the furious Sandra, who blamed Alice, to join with him in deliberate loud conversation to sabotage Alice’s tryout. When confronted, Glendon also admitted arranging with the front desk not to call Janice. When he called her on the cell phone disguising his voice, the others were already at the tryout. His plan worked after a fashion, spurring the three actresses to greater performances. But it may have also have set the stage for revenge as the play progressed later that summer.\nFor the time being, however, the diplomatic Rex Lansford saved the day. “Rosemary is a great part, but so also are the two female supporting roles. I’m sure we’ll all work well together,” he said with a smile, “both here at the Straw Hat Theater, and during the movie I’m sure will be made of this fine play. Now let’s get on with the tryouts!”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Identify what has to be explained  \n   • Why Sandra’s customary hot-lemonade suddenly contained vinegar.  \n   • Why Alice’s monologue was effectively ruined by the director himself.  \n   • Why Janice’s wake-up call “wasn’t” made until she was already late.\n\n2. Who would profit?  \n   • Any of the three actresses might want to cripple the others, but whichever of them succeeded would still have to impress the director in the ensuing chaos.  \n   • Arthur Glendon, on the other hand, could be using the chaos itself as an informal “screen test” to see who reacted most like the mischievous heroine of his new play.\n\n3. Opportunity for the vinegar trick  \n   • Only somebody who both (a) knew Sandra’s inviolable habit of drinking hot lemonade during rehearsal and (b) was alone with the insulated flask long enough to tamper with it.  \n   • Arthur was “first on the set as usual.” The actresses arrived after him.  \n   • Alice merely poured from a container that was already tainted; she never had an unsupervised moment with it.\n\n4. Sabotaging Alice’s monologue  \n   • The loud twenty-minute “conversation” that drowned her performance involved Arthur himself and Sandra, who at that point believed Alice had dosed her drink.  \n   • But Alice’s failure benefits only a person who wants to test her under pressure—not someone who wants the part for herself. Arthur again gains information; Sandra gains a handicap (she still has no voice).\n\n5. Janice’s missing wake-up call  \n   • Arthur is shown making a cell-phone call just before the auditions start.  \n   • The front desk receives its instructions from the theater’s producer, not from a rival actress.  \n   • Arthur’s refusal to send anyone to fetch Janice shows foreknowledge that she would be late.\n\n6. Motive and pattern  \n   • Every act of “sabotage” is perfectly aligned with the plot of the new play, which Arthur specifically chose for its devil-may-care heroine.  \n   • None of the three women could have carried out all three bits of mischief; each was busy protecting herself from the others through the night.\n\nConclusion: The only person with the knowledge, motive, and uninterrupted opportunity to pull off the whole sequence is Arthur Glendon.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nArthur Glendon, Janice Starling, Alice Cartwright, Sandra Buckingham\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nArthur Glendon\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• The evening before auditions, Arthur decides to recreate the “anything-to-get-the-part” antics of his new comedy and observe how his three candidates cope in real life.  \n• Very early the next morning he visits the set, spikes the insulated lemonade urn with a hefty splash of vinegar—knowing Sandra will be the first to ask for it—and then heads back to greet the actresses.  \n• Before leaving the lodge he phones the desk, orders them to delay Janice Starling’s wake-up call, and later telephones her himself (in a disguised voice) only after the other two have already arrived.  \n• During the auditions he encourages Sandra’s fury and joins her in loud banter, purposely drowning out Alice’s monologue to see whether she stays in character under fire.  \n• After watching all three women struggle and still deliver strong readings, he is satisfied that his improvised “test” has accomplished what he wanted: it revealed who could think— and act— like the play’s trickster heroine.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJanice Starling: She was unconscious—literally asleep— until the delayed wake-up call. She had no access to the set or lemonade and in fact became one of the victims.\n\nAlice Cartwright: Her only contact with the lemonade was pouring it after Sandra requested it. It was already tainted, proving the tampering took place earlier. She could not have blocked Janice’s call, and sabotaging Sandra would not explain why Arthur himself stifled Alice’s own audition.\n\nSandra Buckingham: She never left her room after the late-night rehearsal ruckus (Alice pounded on her ceiling). At the audition she was the first victim, not the saboteur; moreover, her throat was impaired until just before her reading, making it impossible for her to have staged the vinegar trick for her own benefit.\n\nTherefore all deliberate sabotage traces back to the one man with motive, means, and continuous opportunity: director-producer Arthur Glendon.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
