      "content": "“You’re the worst detective ever,” said my brother. “What does that make you?” I shot back. “You’re WORKING for the worst detective ever.” My brother Larry didn’t say anything. He just glared at the phone, which sat silently on his messy desk. It hadn’t rung in more than two days. And that had been a wrong number. We’d been working together for three years, and we were starting to drive each other crazy. Larry came in to work with me, and we left together at the end of the day. And since we hadn’t had a customer all week, we’d spent a full eight hours every day cooped up together in our tiny office—and then all night watching detective reruns in the apartment we shared. Three years ago, the two of us had become famous after finding a stolen painting. It disappeared from a banker’s Halloween party, and the reporters had a lot of fun writing about the “haunted mansion.” When we’d figured out the painting’s whereabouts, they’d naturally written more stories, this time celebrating Larry and me as brilliant detectives. But the banker was one of our neighbors, and our “brilliant” detecting had just been to notice him smuggling the painting to an art collector as soon as the police stopped watching him. It was my brother Larry who’d gotten the bright idea of cashing in on our success by forming a detective agency. (“HERO DETECTIVES LAUNCH INVESTIGATION OFFICE” blared one headline in the local newspaper.) We’d framed the article and hung it on our wall the day we opened. It was still hanging there—over the phone that hadn’t rung in two days. And then we heard footsteps coming down the hallway ... Larry looked at me, and the few hairs left on his head were sticking up with alarm. No one ever walked down our hallway—and least of all, customers. Was it a criminal who we’d locked away, finally coming back for revenge? Larry nodded towards the door, signaling that he wanted me to answer it. And then he tiptoed toward the corner and hid in the closet. I was worried, too. The glass on our door was frosted, but I could see the outline of an enormous body —and then a giant fist pounded abruptly on the wood. I’d had enough of this detective business, and flung open the door. The mysterious guest had a bucket and a mop. It was our janitor, Joe. I sighed with relief, and Joe smiled back. “Did I scare you?” he asked. “I was trying to scare you.” “Detectives don’t scare easily,” I said. And then Larry opened the door of the closet and reentered the room. Joe stifled a smile, and Larry said defensively, “I was looking for clues.” Joe laughed, and said, “Are you sure you weren't looking for coats?” Larry grumbled that next he’d try to locate his missing dignity. “How about finding this month’s rent?” Joe suggested. I started to explain we were working on a big case. “Yeah, the case of the missing rent,” Joe persisted. I could see Larry getting annoyed. But then Joe said, “No, I’m serious. I can’t find this month’s rent checks. Everybody stuffs them into that rent box on the wall by the manager’s door. The box was fine when I left last night. But when I came in this morning—the box was open, and empty. I think someone picked the lock and stole all the rent checks.” “Ours was in there already,” Larry lied. “If it’s missing, that’s not our fault.” “Would you shut up and listen to me?” Joe snapped. “Mr. Jorgensen always pays his rent in cash—so there was one thousand dollars in that box! If I don’t find it, he’s going to think I stole it.” “Why would he think you stole it?” Joe reached into his gray overalls and pulled out an enormous set of jangling keys. “Janitors have keys to the whole building,” he said sadly, “including the rent box. And now that it’s missing—I’m the likeliest suspect.” It was quiet for a second, until Larry finally blurted out, “Are you hiring us?” “Tell you what,” Joe said wearily. “From the way you’re acting I’m guessing you guys still haven’t paid your rent yet. Am I right?” Larry and I both nodded. “Find that money before the manager gets here, and I won’t tell him that you guys were late again this month.” It was the best offer we’d gotten all week. “But how do we know you didn’t steal it?” Larry teased. “You don’t,” Joe said. “I’d like a thousand bucks as much as anybody.” He slid his bucket into the hallway, and headed for the elevator. *\t\t\t\t*\t\t\t\t* Larry and I ordered sandwiches—we always thought better after a good meal. We were happy and cheerful when they finally arrived, and as we munched away, Larry tossed out some theories. “Maybe Mr. Jorgensen is late on his rent too,” he said, wiping some mustard off his lips. “So Jorgensen breaks into the box, and then claims he’s paid his rent already.\" “Like what you tried to do.” “Exactly.” “Maybe you stole the money,” I said. I took a bite of my roast beef sandwich, then offered yet another theory. “Or maybe the building manager stole the money. He’s going to keep the thousand dollars, and then blame the theft on Joe.” “Or maybe Joe stole the money,” Larry said, “and he’s going to blame it on the building manager.” My head was starting to hurt. Just then, there was another knock on our door. Larry grumbled about his lunch was being interrupted as he carried his sandwich with him to his closet hiding place. “Who is it?” I asked, swallowing the last of my roast beef. “It’s Mr. Jorgensen,” said an elderly voice. From the closet, Larry called in a high-pitched voice, “Mr. Jorgensen who?” “Mr. Jorgensen-wants to-wring-your-neck. Now open the door, you jackass.” I looked over at Larry, and asked, “Why are you giving him a hard time?” Larry looked sheepish. “I owe him money, too.” Mr. Jorgensen looked very angry when we finally opened the door. “Hello, boys,” he said. We weren’t boys, but Mr. Jorgensen was nearly sixty years old—so to him, everyone looked younger. His sweater was probably older than we were, and even it looked angry. It was red with a crooked, darker red stripe that made it look like the sweater was scowling at us. “Would you like a sandwich?” asked Larry. Mr. Jorgensen shook his head. “My stomach can’t handle anything stronger than soup,” he complained. “You know what it's like to eat nothing but soup?” In response, Larry just took a big bite of his sandwich. This irritated Mr. Jorgensen, and he glared straight at Larry. “So, any chance you’ll be paying me back that five hundred dollars you borrowed from me?” “It’s funny that you mention that,” Larry said, his mouth still full. “Just yesterday I came by your office to pay you. But you were busy with a client, so I decided not to interrupt you.” “You’re lying,” said Mr. Jorgensen. “See this?” He gestured towards his neck. Larry and I both stared at his ugly sweater. Poking over the neckline was about two inches of what was probably a red silk Hawaiian shirt. Mr. Jorgensen also had a dark suntan, a result of his recent trip to Hawaii, and he explained, “I just got back from the airport—and I’m on my way up to the office now—I definitely wasn’t here yesterday.” “Did I say yesterday?” Larry asked. “Oh, uh … I meant … last Christmas.” Mr. Jorgensen mumbled something under his breath—though I definitely heard the word “stupid”—and shuffled out of our office. “You’re making friends with everybody,” I said. And once again, we heard footsteps coming down the hall. Returning to the closet, Larry shoved the last of his sandwich into his mouth. This time the closet was a good idea, because the man at our doorway was the building manager—and he was so mad that his face was red. By the time our door swung open, he was already shouting. “Give me one reason why I shouldn’t throw you two out of here!” Larry stayed in the closet. I sighed and said, “Because we’re trying to help Joe find your missing rent money?” That slowed him down. He was probably just as mad about the missing rent as he was at us for missing rent. He thought for a second. “I think it was someone in the building who stole the rent,” he said. “Someone busted open the back door and went straight to the rent box by my office. So it had to be someone who knew exactly where to look. Someone like you.” “But it could’ve been anyone,” I said. “Why are you blaming us?” “Because you’re the only guys who haven’t paid your rent this month,” he said. “And besides—I don’t like you. Your brother is a big wise guy. Where is he, anyways?” “Oh, he’s around here someplace,” I said, trying not to stare at the closet. Our building manager stomped out of the office. It was quiet for nearly a minute, until I heard Larry’s voice whispering, “Is he gone?” I turned to the closet, then said, “Look at us. We’ve got no money, and everybody hates us. Maybe we should quit the detective business altogether.” Opening the door to the closet, Larry laughed. “Not today. I had lots of time to think in there—and I’ve figured out who stole the rent money!”",

And since we hadn’t had a customer all week, we’d spent a full eight hours every day cooped up together in our tiny office—and then all night watching detective reruns in the apartment we shared. Three years ago, the two of us had become famous after finding a stolen painting. It disappeared from a banker’s Halloween party, and the reporters had a lot of fun writing about the “haunted mansion.” When we’d figured out the painting’s whereabouts, they’d naturally written more stories, this time celebrating Larry and me as brilliant detectives. But the banker was one of our neighbors, and our “brilliant” detecting had just been to notice him smuggling the painting to an art collector as soon as the police stopped watching him. It was my brother Larry who’d gotten the bright idea of cashing in on our success by forming a detective agency. (“HERO DETECTIVES LAUNCH INVESTIGATION OFFICE” blared one headline in the local newspaper.) We’d framed the article and hung it on our wall the day we opened. It was still hanging there—over the phone that hadn’t rung in two days. And then we heard footsteps coming down the hallway ... Larry looked at me, and the few hairs left on his head were sticking up with alarm. No one ever walked down our hallway—and least of all, customers. Was it a criminal who we’d locked away, finally coming back for revenge? Larry nodded towards the door, signaling that he wanted me to answer it. And then he tiptoed toward the corner and hid in the closet. I was worried, too. The glass on our door was frosted, but I could see the outline of an enormous body —and then a giant fist pounded abruptly on the wood. I’d had enough of this detective business, and flung open the door. The mysterious guest had a bucket and a mop. It was our janitor, Joe. I sighed with relief, and Joe smiled back. “Did I scare you?” he asked. “I was trying to scare you.” “Detectives don’t scare easily,” I said. And then Larry opened the door of the closet and reentered the room. Joe stifled a smile, and Larry said defensively, “I was looking for clues.” Joe laughed, and said, “Are you sure you weren't looking for coats?” Larry grumbled that next he’d try to locate his missing dignity. “How about finding this month’s rent?” Joe suggested. I started to explain we were working on a big case. “Yeah, the case of the missing rent,” Joe persisted. I could see Larry getting annoyed. But then Joe said, “No, I’m serious. I can’t find this month’s rent checks. Everybody stuffs them into that rent box on the wall by the manager’s door. The box was fine when I left last night. But when I came in this morning—the box was open, and empty. I think someone picked the lock and stole all the rent checks.” “Ours was in there already,” Larry lied. “If it’s missing, that’s not our fault.” “Would you shut up and listen to me?” Joe snapped. “Mr. Jorgensen always pays his rent in cash—so there was one thousand dollars in that box! If I don’t find it, he’s going to think I stole it.” “Why would he think you stole it?” Joe reached into his gray overalls and pulled out an enormous set of jangling keys. “Janitors have keys to the whole building,” he said sadly, “including the rent box. And now that it’s missing—I’m the likeliest suspect.” It was quiet for a second, until Larry finally blurted out, “Are you hiring us?” “Tell you what,” Joe said wearily. “From the way you’re acting I’m guessing you guys still haven’t paid your rent yet. Am I right?” Larry and I both nodded. “Find that money before the manager gets here, and I won’t tell him that you guys were late again this month.” It was the best offer we’d gotten all week. “But how do we know you didn’t steal it?” Larry teased. “You don’t,” Joe said. “I’d like a thousand bucks as much as anybody.” He slid his bucket into the hallway, and headed for the elevator. *\t\t\t\t*\t\t\t\t* Larry and I ordered sandwiches—we always thought better after a good meal. We were happy and cheerful when they finally arrived, and as we munched away, Larry tossed out some theories. “Maybe Mr. Jorgensen is late on his rent too,” he said, wiping some mustard off his lips. “So Jorgensen breaks into the box, and then claims he’s paid his rent already.\" “Like what you tried to do.” “Exactly.” “Maybe you stole the money,” I said. I took a bite of my roast beef sandwich, then offered yet another theory. “Or maybe the building manager stole the money. He’s going to keep the thousand dollars, and then blame the theft on Joe.” “Or maybe Joe stole the money,” Larry said, “and he’s going to blame it on the building manager.” My head was starting to hurt. Just then, there was another knock on our door. Larry grumbled about his lunch was being interrupted as he carried his sandwich with him to his closet hiding place. “Who is it?” I asked, swallowing the last of my roast beef. “It’s Mr. Jorgensen,” said an elderly voice. From the closet, Larry called in a high-pitched voice, “Mr. Jorgensen who?” “Mr. Jorgensen-wants to-wring-your-neck. Now open the door, you jackass.” I looked over at Larry, and asked, “Why are you giving him a hard time?” Larry looked sheepish. “I owe him money, too.” Mr. Jorgensen looked very angry when we finally opened the door. “Hello, boys,” he said. We weren’t boys, but Mr. Jorgensen was nearly sixty years old—so to him, everyone looked younger. His sweater was probably older than we were, and even it looked angry. It was red with a crooked, darker red stripe that made it look like the sweater was scowling at us. “Would you like a sandwich?” asked Larry. Mr. Jorgensen shook his head. “My stomach can’t handle anything stronger than soup,” he complained. “You know what it's like to eat nothing but soup?” In response, Larry just took a big bite of his sandwich. This irritated Mr. Jorgensen, and he glared straight at Larry. “So, any chance you’ll be paying me back that five hundred dollars you borrowed from me?” “It’s funny that you mention that,” Larry said, his mouth still full. “Just yesterday I came by your office to pay you. But you were busy with a client, so I decided not to interrupt you.” “You’re lying,” said Mr. Jorgensen. “See this?” He gestured towards his neck. Larry and I both stared at his ugly sweater. Poking over the neckline was about two inches of what was probably a red silk Hawaiian shirt. Mr. Jorgensen also had a dark suntan, a result of his recent trip to Hawaii, and he explained, “I just got back from the airport—and I’m on my way up to the office now—I definitely wasn’t here yesterday.” “Did I say yesterday?” Larry asked. “Oh, uh … I meant … last Christmas.” Mr. Jorgensen mumbled something under his breath—though I definitely heard the word “stupid”—and shuffled out of our office. “You’re making friends with everybody,” I said. And once again, we heard footsteps coming down the hall. Returning to the closet, Larry shoved the last of his sandwich into his mouth. This time the closet was a good idea, because the man at our doorway was the building manager—and he was so mad that his face was red. By the time our door swung open, he was already shouting. “Give me one reason why I shouldn’t throw you two out of here!” Larry stayed in the closet. I sighed and said, “Because we’re trying to help Joe find your missing rent money?” That slowed him down. He was probably just as mad about the missing rent as he was at us for missing rent. He thought for a second. “I think it was someone in the building who stole the rent,” he said. “Someone busted open the back door and went straight to the rent box by my office. So it had to be someone who knew exactly where to look. Someone like you.” “But it could’ve been anyone,” I said. “Why are you blaming us?” “Because you’re the only guys who haven’t paid your rent this month,” he said. “And besides—I don’t like you. Your brother is a big wise guy. Where is he, anyways?” “Oh, he’s around here someplace,” I said, trying not to stare at the closet. Our building manager stomped out of the office. It was quiet for nearly a minute, until I heard Larry’s voice whispering, “Is he gone?” I turned to the closet, then said, “Look at us. We’ve got no money, and everybody hates us. Maybe we should quit the detective business altogether.” Opening the door to the closet, Larry laughed. “Not today. I had lots of time to think in there—and I’ve figured out who stole the rent money!”\n“I figured you stole the rent money,” I told Larry.\n“When would I have had time to do it?” he countered. “You’re here with me eight hours a day, and you’re watching TV with me all night.”\n“Okay, you’re innocent,” I said. “But what about Joe, the janitor?”\n“He’s not the guy.” Larry was confident. “He’s got that big set of keys to the building, right? So he wouldn’t have busted open the back door just to get to the rent box. And it couldn’t have been Mr. Jorgensen either, because he was on vacation when the rent box was robbed.\n“In fact, it was all the money we owed that finally cracked the case,” Larry said proudly—“the fact that we were late on our rent.”\n“Are you saying our building manager faked the robbery?” I asked, and Larry nodded vigrously.\n“If the rent box was empty when he came to the building—then how would he know that we hadn’t paid our rent?”\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Who had a motive?\n   • The detectives – they are broke and late with their own rent.  \n   • Joe the janitor – needs money and would be the first person blamed because he has keys.  \n   • Mr Jorgensen – always pays in cash; if the box is empty he could claim he paid, saving \\$1 000.  \n   • The building manager – could pocket every tenant’s rent in one grab and then accuse somebody else.\n\n2. Who had an opportunity?\n   • Everybody in the building knows where the rent box is, but the manager and the janitor are the only two who can be sure the other tenants have probably deposited their envelopes by the first week of the month.  \n   • Joe and the manager both have keys; no one else is likely to have them.  \n   • The detectives were in their office all day yesterday and every evening watching television with each other, so neither brother had a moment when the other couldn’t account for him.  \n   • Mr Jorgensen was on a flight back from Hawaii and only reached the building a short time before we meet him – establishing a solid alibi.\n\n3. Physical evidence / behaviour clues\n   • The back door has been “busted open,” something a person who already possesses keys would not need to do – so the break-in looks staged.  \n   • Joe points out that very fact himself (“why pick a lock on the rent box when he’s already got the keys?”).  \n   • The decisive clue: the manager bellows that the detectives are “the only guys who haven’t paid your rent this month.”  \n        – If the rent box was completely empty when he discovered it, there is no way he could know whose payments were missing; he would simply know that everyone’s envelopes were gone.  \n        – For him to single out the two brothers, he must already have known beforehand that their envelopes were not inside the box.  \n        – The only way he could know that fact is if he had opened the box earlier and seen the contents – in other words, he is the thief.\n\n4. Logical deduction\n   • Joe can’t be the culprit: he has keys and therefore wouldn’t need to smash a door; and if he were framing somebody else he wouldn’t call attention to the theft first thing in the morning.  \n   • Mr Jorgensen can’t be the culprit: he was away in Hawaii until just minutes before we meet him.  \n   • The detectives can’t be the culprits: they are always together, have no keys, and, as Larry himself notices, they would have no reason to batter open a door when they could simply slip their own cheque in and claim innocence.  \n   • Only the manager both (a) had prior knowledge of whose rent was missing and (b) had the chance to stage a fake burglary.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLarry (the brother), The Narrator (his brother), Joe the janitor, Mr. Jorgensen (elderly tenant), The Building Manager\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nThe Building Manager (name not given)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nRent weekend arrives. Almost all tenants have slipped their envelopes into the rent box beside the manager’s office.  \nEarly this morning the manager opens the box with his key, removes every cheque and the \\$1 000 in cash from Mr Jorgensen, and hides the take.  \nTo divert suspicion he unlocks, then visibly breaks, the rear entrance to make it look as if someone forced his way in from outside. He leaves the rent-box door hanging open.  \nWhen Joe comes in to start work, he finds the empty box and alerts the detectives, hoping they can clear his own name.  \nA short time later the manager confronts the detectives. Forgetting what his story implies, he blurts out that they are “the only guys who haven’t paid,” revealing that he already knew whose payments were missing – knowledge he could not possibly have if the first time he looked into the box it was already empty.  \nThat slip exposes him as the thief who staged the break-in.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Larry and the Narrator – They are together almost every waking hour, giving one another a solid alibi. They also had no key and would have no need to smash a door they use every day.  \n• Joe the Janitor – Because he carries a full set of keys, he would simply open the door and the rent box; the pointless damage to the rear door argues against him. Moreover, he risks becoming the primary suspect by reporting the theft himself.  \n• Mr Jorgensen – He was on a flight back from Hawaii until moments before he visits the detectives; the theft was discovered earlier that morning. His cash payment is what was actually stolen, so he lost money, he did not gain it.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
