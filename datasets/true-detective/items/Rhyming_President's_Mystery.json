On one day it's customary\n-- third Monday in February -- to remember all the greats\nleading the United States. For their presidential glory,\nwe present a rhyming story. But six lines will hide a clue.\nThere's a mystery here too! In some states, the schools are closed.\n(Special rules are now imposed.) But a boy named Bill forgot.\nThinking he would still be taught, he ran proudly to his school\nat 8:10 (which was the rule), Carrying quite recklessly\nSchool books teaching history. Yet the day had left its mark.\nAt the school, the rooms were dark. Through the window, Bill peeked, wary \nat the unlit school library. In the grey dawn's light he spied \non the building's dark inside. Bill saw paintings hanging solemn\nby the doorway's entrance column. They faced paintings on the wall.\nWashington was standing tall. Paintings there would represent\nEvery U.S. president. There were 44 in all,\nhanging from his dark school wall. George Bush senior, and his son\nstared back at George Washington. Lincoln frowned, and Reagan, too.\nAnd Obama. (He is new!) Cleveland, Clinton, Kennedy\nand Jackson (from Tennessee). Nixon, Johnson, Harrison\nall looked to George Washington. Suddenly, the room awoke\nand the presidents all spoke! \"Wake up, George,\" one painting said.\n\"It's the holiday you dread!\" They were teasing, and George smiled\nat the way that he'd been riled. \"Polk,\" he said, \"you've got it wrong.\"\nPolk replied \"It's been too long. Our spirits must wait a year\nFor this day to re-appear.\" Polk leaned grandly on a shelf.\nLincoln chuckled to himself. \"My dad and I both were chosen,\"\nsaid George Bush, his face unfrozen. \"So was mine! We both were winning!\"\nyelled John Quincy Adams, grinning. Two cousins were President.\nRoosevelts -- so confident. They gave Harrison some tweaks.\nHis term lasted just four weeks! Nixon said that pain he knew.\nHe'd left his term early too! Lincoln nodded, without speaking.\nWilson's painting started creaking. To the window he was pointing\nat something quite disappointing. \"In the White House, we worked lonely\nwith our best advisors only. But a young face pays a visit\nby the window. There -- what is it? Where the holiday light shone.\nSee that boy? We're not alone!\" Bill, embarrassed, turned to go.\nWhy he stayed he didn't know. But it was a chance to see\nfamous men from history. And to know and hear today\nwhat the presidents would say. Filled with awe and fascination,\nhe entered the conversation. \"Hello, Mr. Presidents.\n Hope you like your residence.\" \"It's quite grand,\" said Jefferson.\n\"My painting gets lots of sun!\" Monroe added, speaking slow, \n\"We can watch the children grow. Smiling while we watch them learn,\nhoping that good grades they'll earn.\" \"If you're smart,\" Abe Lincoln said,\n\"You could hang up here instead. We were all boys once, like you.\nYou could be President too!\" \"Or your wife,\" said Clinton, straight.\n\"My wife tried back in '08.\" \"It's a privilege that's earned,\nBased partly on what you've learned. I was poor,\" Abe Lincoln said.\n\"But I studied hard -- I read. Soon my speeches moved the nation,\nAnd I won inauguration.\" Andrew Johnson followed him.\n\"It was hard,\" said Johnson, grim. \"After Lincoln, I could see\nthat the states did not agree. And the Congress overreached.\nPretty soon, I got impeached!\" Wilson knew the weight they bore. \n\"When I served, we were at war.\" Truman knew that struggle too. \nHe'd started in World War II. He'd hoped his war would be last.\nBut another followed fast. Johnson, Nixon, Kennedy\nall knew war, they could agree. But Nixon knew triumphs soon.\n\"I sent men up to the moon! But to be the one selected\nis the best -- to be elected. I lost once, but then I won.\nMy slogan? 'Nixon's the one!'\" Truman laughed at what he'd said.\n\"Papers said I'd lost instead. A mistake -- it's only human.\nThey'd wrote 'Dewey defeats Truman!'\" Ford said, \"Yes, my greatest news\nwas to be the one they'd choose. When the ballots all were sent,\nI'd been elected president.\" Harrison's term started great.\n\"Idaho became a state!\" Jefferson said \"And Montana.\nBut I bought Louisiana! It was territory, though.\nNot a state until Monroe.\" Bill's wide eyes were filled with glee\nat the living pageantry. They'd been speaking for an hour\nHarding, Taft, and Eisenhower. But he'd listened carefully\nto these men from history. One stood out, before too long,\nAnd he knew something was wrong. \"Leaders of America\nOne of you's a replica! A cheap copy, with some tainting\nof the true artist's real painting. I can tell this painting's new.\nHe said things that weren't true! He's a forgery and hid it.\"\n\"Do you think Bill Clinton did it?\" Adams, in his fancy suit, \nseemed ready to prosecute. \"Or is Woodrow Wilson lying?\n Which fake president is spying? Finding fakes could be quite fun.\nMaybe Nixon IS the one.\" In this presidential garden,\nNixon said \"I beg your pardon?\" Then he gave a dirty look.\n\"Don't blame me! I'm not a crook!

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What exactly is the “crime”?\n   • One of the forty-four presidential portraits hanging in the school library has been stolen and replaced with a forged copy.\n   • Nothing else is missing or damaged, so the case is strictly “theft and substitution.”\n\n2. Which portrait is the forgery?\n   • Every picture “speaks” about something that is historically correct – except one.\n   • The canvas that claims:\n        “When the ballots all were sent,\n         I’d been elected president.”\n     is the portrait of Gerald R. Ford.\n   • Fact: Ford was never elected; he succeeded Nixon in August 1974 and then lost the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter.\n   • Therefore the Ford painting is the fake; the genuine Ford portrait is the one Bill later sees “by my teacher’s chair.”\n\n3. Who could have carried out the substitution?\n   • Requirements: a. ability to enter both the library and a classroom outside normal hours,\n                   b. motive to possess or use the real painting,\n                   c. enough knowledge of the display to know that a missing canvas would be noticed.\n   • Realistic suspects inside the story world:\n        – Bill (the boy) – had opportunity this morning, but no motive *before* he saw anything.\n        – The janitor / custodian – has keys and opportunity, but no shown motive and would have had to paint a historically inaccurate fake.\n        – The librarian – likewise has keys, but is never mentioned as being in the building.\n        – Bill’s homeroom history teacher – possesses the original (it is literally seen “hanging by my teacher’s chair”), had easy access to both locations, and would want the portrait for an in-class President’s-Day display or personal study.\n        – An outside burglar – would have stolen, not substituted, and would hardly leave the loot hanging in a classroom.\n\n4. Motive analysis\n   • Teachers commonly decorate their rooms for a themed lesson or assembly.  A presidential portrait on President’s Day is perfect material.\n   • By hanging a hastily painted copy in the library the teacher hoped the absence of the real canvas would go unnoticed until after the holiday.\n\n5. Opportunity / access\n   • Teachers possess school keys and can come in on weekends or holidays to prepare lessons.\n   • A teacher could move the Ford painting after classes the previous afternoon or early that morning; the building is otherwise locked, giving other staff an alibi.\n\n6. Physical evidence\n   • The genuine Ford portrait is in the teacher’s classroom.\n   • The fake Ford portrait is on the library wall and betrays its lack of authenticity by containing a historical error.\n   • No one else is in possession of the stolen item.\n\n7. Logical deduction\n   • Only one character is physically shown to have the stolen property: Bill’s teacher.\n   • Therefore Bill’s teacher is the individual who stole the original and placed the forgery.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBill (the student), Janitor, Librarian, School Principal, Bill’s History Teacher\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nBill’s History Teacher  (name not given in the story)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Anticipating a President’s-Day lesson, the history teacher decides the class would benefit from studying an original presidential portrait up close.  \n• The day before the holiday the teacher unlocks the library, removes Gerald Ford’s portrait, and hangs it beside their desk in the classroom.  \n• To avoid leaving a conspicuous empty space the teacher rapidly paints or procures a look-alike canvas.  In haste the teacher includes a factual blunder (“I’d been elected president”) that the genuine Ford never could claim.  \n• Early on President’s Day the school is closed; no one is expected inside.  Bill, forgetting the holiday, arrives, notices the dark building, and peers through the library window.  \n• The portraits “come alive” in Bill’s imagination/conscience; their conversations highlight their individual historical truths, making the forged Ford statement stick out.  \n• Bill enters, confirms the error, searches classrooms, and discovers the real portrait hanging by his teacher’s chair.  \n• Bill thus unmasks the forgery and, by extension, the teacher who performed the swap.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Bill – had no prior access; he only discovered the switch after the fact and immediately reported it.  \n• Janitor – while having keys, is never linked to either the forgery or the classroom; nothing stolen ends up in the janitor’s possession.  \n• Librarian – not present on the holiday and would have no reason to hide the picture in a classroom.  \n• Principal – similarly absent and gains nothing from the substitution.  \n• Therefore only the teacher, who actually holds the missing original, had motive, means, and opportunity, making him or her—and no one else—the culprit.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
