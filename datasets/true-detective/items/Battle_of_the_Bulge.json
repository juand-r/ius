      "content": "\"Stop here!\" ordered Captain Conrad. \"Look at that signpost. It points in the wrong direction!\" Private Johnson, the captain's driver, squinted through the fog. \"If you say so, sir. I don't remember exactly which way it pointed before.\" \"Well, I do,\" said the captain. \"When we were here three hours ago, it said: turn north for Malmedy and south for Bastogne. Now it says south for Malmedy and north for Bastogne. Pull over and help me turn it back.\" The turned-around signpost meant an enemy spy had been there. German agents in American uniforms were driving captured jeeps behind the American lines, causing havoc and confusion wherever they went. They had all spent time in America as children, so they spoke fluent English with no foreign accent. Turning signs the wrong way was one of their favorite tricks. Back in the jeep, the captain said: \"Let's get back to headquarters now. There's a German spy in the area!\" Too bad the captain didn't have a cell phone. But it was December, 1944 - long before cell phones - and the Battle of the Bulge had just begun. Germany's final surrender was less than five months away, but in the Ardennes Woods of Belgium, American forces were reeling under a furious Nazi assault. The German army had just launched its last major attack of World War Two. Captain Conrad and his driver were heading back to headquarters after a long day in the field when they saw the sabotaged sign. The jeep pulled away from the crossroads. The two soldiers rode silently through narrow, winding mountain roads, the rugged woods around them shrouded in fog and the gathering twilight. Suddenly, an abandoned jeep loomed up at them out of the fog. \"Stop here,\" said the captain. \"I want to check out this jeep. It's not one of ours.\" Conrad got out of his own jeep, and walked around the abandoned one. He touched the hood, then got in the driver's seat. He turned on the ignition, but nothing happened. He looked at some papers in the glove box, then jumped back in his own vehicle. \"The spy who turned that sign must have come in this jeep,\" he told Johnson. \"There are German papers in it. But it's out of gas, so he must be on foot. The engine's still fairly warm, so he couldn't have gotten far.\" \"I don't see any footprints in the woods,\" said Johnson. \"He must have gone on down the road.\" \"There are his footprints,\" said the captain, pointing his flashlight ahead. \"Holy cow! That's the same direction we're going, Captain,\" Johnson exclaimed. \"And headquarters is just a mile up the road. He must be in camp!\" \"I think so, Johnson. So step on it! We need to get back now.\" The sun had just set as Captain Conrad burst through the door into the front hall of the abandoned farmhouse that served as his headquarters. \"Sergeant Polonski! Did any stragglers arrive while I was gone?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Polonski, flipping through his clipboard. \"There were four: Anderson, Dilworth, Maguire, and Siegel. They're down in the shed with Corporal Riley now.\" \"Are you absolutely sure only four came in while I was gone?\" \"Absolutely, sir. I doubled up on sentries the whole time you were gone. Everyone who showed up is in the shed.\" \"Well, round up the extra sentries into a guard detail, and get down to the shed right away,\" said the captain. \"One of those men is a German spy!\" Five minutes later, Sergeant Polonski and the guards met Captain Conrad at the shed. Then they all saw something unusual. Suddenly, five candles in the shed window were lit, one by one. Five small flames twinkled in the gloom. The soldiers outside exchanged quizzical glances, but said nothing. Then Conrad and Polonski stepped inside. \"Ten-HUT!\" cried Corporal Riley as they walked in. \"At ease, corporal. You men, stay at attention,\" the captain told the stragglers. \"Who just lit those candles in the window?\" \"I did, sir,\" said Siegel, one of the stragglers. \"Why? To signal the enemy how many men were in here?\" \"Oh, no sir! They're for the festival of lights!\" \"Where are you from, Siegel? Who's your favorite big-league slugger?\" \"I'm a Yankee fan, sir, from the Bronx, you know, so that's Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. Last week I was a battalion clerk, but - that was before the enemy overran us.\" \"At ease, Siegel,\" the captain said. Then he turned to Maguire, who rocked slowly from side to side, sweating and shivering. \"What's wrong with you, soldier? Nervous about something?\" \"No, sir,\" Maguire whispered hoarsely. \"I'm sick. Must be something I ate. I haven't felt this bad since D-Day. I got so seasick when they delayed the invasion, and we rode out that storm in the hold of the ship.\" \"At ease, soldier,\" said the captain. \"Sit down til you feel better.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" replied Maguire, as he slumped into a chair. \"By the way, where are you from and who's your favorite slugger?\" \"I'm from Boston, sir - the home of the bean and the cod. So Ted Williams is my guy.\" Captain Conrad turned to the third straggler. \"Who are you, soldier?\" \"Anderson, sir. I'm a rifleman and Missourian. My dad served in World War One and saw his first action at Chateau-Thierry while my great-granddad saw Lee's rebels surrender to Grant at Appomattox.\" \"Why would your great-granddad fight for the Union? Wasn't Missouri a slave state?\" \"Yes sir, it was a slave state, captain. But anti-slavery sentiment was pretty strong in some parts. So the slavers never took over the state legislature, and the state never seceded from the Union. So Missouri sent some mighty fine regiments to the Grand Old Army, sir - and some to the rebels, too.\" \"Who's your favorite big-league slugger, Anderson?\" \"Well, I'm a St. Louis Cardinals fan, captain. I never much cared for the Browns. So I've got a tough choice between Enos Slaughter and Stan Musial.\" \"At ease, Anderson,\" said the captain, and turned to the fourth straggler. \"What's your story, soldier?\" \"I'm Dilworth, sir. I was an artillery spotter - when we had artillery to spot for. I'm from the Bronx, like Siegel. My dad served in World War One, like Anderson's, but at Verdun, not Chateau-Thierry. My favorite slugger? Who else? I can not wait to go back and watch Babe Ruth again!\" \"At ease, Dilworth,\" said Conrad, and turned to Sergeant Polonski. \"What now, captain?\" the sergeant asked. \"I've heard enough from these men. I know who the spy is. Sergeant, arrest that man!\" said the captain, pointing to one of the stragglers. Who did the captain point to? And why?",

          "reveal_text": "The Festival of Lights, or Hanukkah, is a Jewish holiday celebrated in December. It is traditional to light candles in the window at sundown. The Nazis persecuted Jews, and did not allow them in the German army. So a German agent would not light Hanukkah candles, or even know what Hanukkah is. So Siegel was not the spy.\nD-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France on June 6, 1944, was originally scheduled for the day before. However, bad weather forced a 24-hour postponement. Because of military secrecy, neither the enemy nor the American public, were told about the delay until after the war. The only way Maguire could have known about it was if he was there himself. If he landed in France on D-Day, then he wasn't a German spy.\nVery few Germans would know as much about American history as Anderson does. While not proof, it suggests that Anderson is American, not German. The Battle of Chateau-Thierry, where Anderson's dad served, was the first major engagement fought by Americans in France.\nSiegel, Maguire and Anderson all named baseball superstars of the 1940s. Babe Ruth, however, played his last full season in 1934, suggesting that Dilworth hadn't seen a major-league game in at least ten years.\nDilworth's remark about his father was as good as a confession. His dad might have served at Verdun during World War One, but not for the American army! The Battle of Verdun was in 1916, and America didn't enter the war until 1917. Even without any other clues, this one tells you that Dilworth is the spy.",

I can not wait to go back and watch Babe Ruth again!\" \"At ease, Dilworth,\" said Conrad, and turned to Sergeant Polonski. \"What now, captain?\" the sergeant asked. \"I've heard enough from these men. I know who the spy is. Sergeant, arrest that man!\" said the captain, pointing to one of the stragglers. Who did the captain point to? And why?\nThe Festival of Lights, or Hanukkah, is a Jewish holiday celebrated in December. It is traditional to light candles in the window at sundown. The Nazis persecuted Jews, and did not allow them in the German army. So a German agent would not light Hanukkah candles, or even know what Hanukkah is. So Siegel was not the spy.\nD-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France on June 6, 1944, was originally scheduled for the day before. However, bad weather forced a 24-hour postponement. Because of military secrecy, neither the enemy nor the American public, were told about the delay until after the war. The only way Maguire could have known about it was if he was there himself. If he landed in France on D-Day, then he wasn't a German spy.\nVery few Germans would know as much about American history as Anderson does. While not proof, it suggests that Anderson is American, not German. The Battle of Chateau-Thierry, where Anderson's dad served, was the first major engagement fought by Americans in France.\nSiegel, Maguire and Anderson all named baseball superstars of the 1940s. Babe Ruth, however, played his last full season in 1934, suggesting that Dilworth hadn't seen a major-league game in at least ten years.\nDilworth's remark about his father was as good as a confession. His dad might have served at Verdun during World War One, but not for the American army! The Battle of Verdun was in 1916, and America didn't enter the war until 1917.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • The saboteur’s purpose is to misdirect troops and gather information behind the American lines. Only a German agent would have that goal.\n\n2. Opportunity  \n   • Whoever drove the abandoned jeep, turned the signpost, and then continued on foot had about thirty-five minutes to cover the last mile to Captain Conrad’s camp.  \n   • Only the four “stragglers” arrived during that interval, so the spy must be one of them: Anderson, Dilworth, Maguire, or Siegel.\n\n3. Physical evidence / alibis  \n   • Siegel lit five Hanukkah candles.  Nazi Germany barred Jews from the Wehrmacht and from all intelligence work.  A Jew would never be chosen as a front-line German agent, so Siegel is almost certainly genuine.  \n   • Maguire complains about having been seasick because the D-Day invasion was postponed one day.  That delay was TOP-SECRET at the time; only men actually on the invasion ships knew it happened.  A German impostor would not possess that bit of trivia, so Maguire sounds genuine.  \n   • Anderson gives a detailed (and correct) explanation of Missouri’s Civil-War politics, then names two contemporary Cardinal stars, Enos Slaughter and rookie Stan Musial—just the ballplayers a real 1944 Missourian would talk about.  \n   • Dilworth says two things that cannot be true for an American:\n        a) “My dad served in World War One, at Verdun.”  The famous Battle of Verdun was fought from February to December 1916—fully a year before the United States entered the war (April 1917).  No American unit fought there in 1916, so an American “dad” could not have been at Verdun.  \n        b) He cannot wait to see Babe Ruth play again.  Ruth retired in 1935 and made only a 28-game farewell attempt with the Boston Braves in 1935.  By December 1944 Ruth had been out of baseball for nearly ten years and was gravely ill; every fan knew he would never suit up again.  A real Bronx baseball lover in 1944 would rave about DiMaggio, Keller or Gordon—not Babe Ruth.  \n   • These two slips show that “Dilworth” is relying on outdated or second-hand information—classic signs of an infiltrator who learned his American background years earlier.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   • Three men (Siegel, Maguire, Anderson) give answers that ring true and, in Siegel’s case, are virtually impossible for a Nazi agent.  \n   • Only Dilworth provides information that is factually impossible for a 1944 American soldier.  Therefore Dilworth is the German spy.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAnderson, Dilworth, Maguire, Siegel\n</SUPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDilworth\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nA German commando fluent in English infiltrated the American rear area in a captured jeep.  After turning a road sign to misdirect traffic, he discovered his fuel was nearly gone and abandoned the vehicle.  Hurrying north on foot he reached the farmhouse headquarters just before sunset, mixing in with other scattered American troops and giving the name “Dilworth.”  \n\nWhen Captain Conrad returned he corralled every newcomer.  During questioning, the impostor tried to bolster his cover with “safe” facts memorized years earlier: claiming a father who fought at Verdun and professing love for Babe Ruth.  Both statements were obsolete or impossible for a 1940s G.I.  Those slips, plus the absence of any other incriminating evidence against the remaining three men, allowed Conrad to expose and arrest the spy.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Siegel ‒ A practicing Jew who openly celebrates Hanukkah; the Nazi regime would never employ Jews as agents, and a Gentile spy would not think to light Hanukkah candles.  \n\n• Maguire ‒ Reveals knowledge of the secret 24-hour postponement of D-Day, information available only to men who were actually aboard the invasion fleet.  Therefore he must be a genuine American veteran, not a German infiltrator.  \n\n• Anderson ‒ Demonstrates detailed, accurate knowledge of Missouri’s divided stance in the Civil War and cites the Cardinals’ current stars, Musial and Slaughter—exactly what a 1944 Missourian fan would say.  His answers show lived experience, not textbook learning.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
