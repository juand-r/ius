      "content": "As Roger headed into the zoo office, he ran into Leonard, a tall man with blond hair. Roger liked Leonard, but sometimes, he went overboard with his practical jokes. He remembered Leonard’s last prank very well. He had snuck Roger’s cowboy hat into the chimpanzee cage. Then Harriet, one of the two chimpanzees, had put it on her head and wouldn’t take it off. Everyone in the crowd that day started laughing. Roger was angry at first but eventually laughed too. “I hope there are no practical jokes today, Leonard,” Roger said. Leonard’s eyes twinkled and then he shrugged. Roger didn’t know what to make of that, but he did know that at least his new hat was safe. Leonard never repeated the same practical joke twice. He said goodbye to Leonard, then walked into the main zoo building. Seated on the bench in front of his office were three students wearing nametags. Roger then remembered that the Zoo manager had asked him to show the students around and figure out who would be the best employee for the summer. The zoo could only afford one of them. Roger was happy to do it as he knew the qualities that the zoo needed. They wanted someone who was knowledgeable, co-operative and loved animals. “Hello, everyone,” Roger said. “Today we’re going to feed a couple of the animals and the four of us will get to know one another. That way I can tell who is most suited to the job.” Tom, a husky boy, sighed. “I hope we’re going to finish this fast, I have to go to a baseball game.” “It’ll take about an hour. “What time’s your game?” “About four,” Tom said. “Should be okay, unless we go into extra innings,” Roger smiled. Roger’s eyes wandered over to the other two students. “You guys care what time we finish?” Cindy shook her head. “No, I don’t have to give blood till seven and I can do my volunteer work at the Church after that.” Tom looked at Cindy. “What are you some kind of saint?” “Just trying to do my part.” Tom grunted. “How about you, Henry?” Roger asked. “I, uh, well...” he said, his right shoulder twitching. “...everything is fine.” The four of them left the building and headed toward the animal cages. The first cage housed the Cockatoo. “This is Wally,” said Roger. He opened a door beside the cage and led the students into a room with a small fridge. Roger had Henry open the fridge and remove a plate of cut fruit and some birdseed. Henry’s hands shook and he accidentally dropped a bit of fruit on the ground. He turned all red. “I’m sorry.” He said. “You’re not going to yell at me are you? I can’t stand being yelled at.” “No, no. Don’t worry, Henry, I drop things too.” Henry nodded then gave the plate to Roger. The students then followed Roger through the door into the feeding area. Cindy moved close to the large white bird. “Hi Wally, what’s up?” Tom stared at Cindy. “I can’t believe you’re talking to that bird. He doesn’t know what you’re saying.” “For your information, Cockatoos are very intelligent. I read they’re as smart as a three year old.” Roger grinned. “That’s right, very good Cindy.” After the Cockatoo had been fed, the three of them ambled over to the elephant cage. “This is Sally,” Roger said. Then he took everyone into the room beside the cage. “Tom can you take that big container of food from the fridge.” Tom shook his head. “I’m not carrying that, it weighs a ton,” “I’ll do it,” said Cindy. The container wobbled in her hands for a moment, but then she was able to hold it steady. “This is going to give me strong muscles for sure.” Henry reached inside the fridge to get the elephant’s desert -- a cantaloupe but it dropped onto the ground. As he picked it up, his body started to quiver. “I’m sorry, please don’t yell.” “Don’t worry so much Henry. Everything is okay.” Cindy handed the food container to Roger and Henry gave him the cantaloupe. Roger and the students then entered the elephants feeding area. “I think elephants are the stupidest animals,” said Tom. “They have that ridiculous trunk and a real dumb expression on their face.” “Actually, they’re very smart,” said Cindy. “They’re the only animal that mourns when one of the other elephants dies.” Roger nodded. “Yes, you’re right once again Cindy. You must study a lot.” “I love animals and like to know everything about them.” Once the elephants were fed, Roger and the three students walked over to the chimpanzee area. “This is Harriet and Charlie,” Roger said as he led the students into the room beside the cage. Then Roger had Henry remove the plate of food from the fridge. This time, Henry didn’t drop a thing. “Good Work, Henry.” “Thanks.” Roger was about to take the plate into the feeding area when he remembered his hat. He was worried that one of the chimps might take it. He didn’t want to lose another hat so he put it on the top of the fridge. Then he took the plate from Henry and went into the feeding area with the students. Harriet had been swinging on a small trapeze in the cage. But when she spotted Roger she raced over to him, still wearing his hat.” Tom shook his head. “I bet she doesn’t have a brain in her head.” “You’re wrong,” said Cindy. “Chimpanzee’s are the only animals that can make tools.” Tom started to laugh. “Tools? What’s he do, make a hammer?” “No, they sharpen sticks so that they can get the ants out of the dirt and eat them.” “That’s disgusting.” Cindy turned to look at Charlie. “He looks so sad. I think he’s upset that he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.” As soon as they exited the feeding area, Roger felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Leonard. “Hey Len. Everyone this is Leonard. He’s another zoo keeper.” All the students said hi except Tom, who looked at his watch. “Hey it’s three thirty. Are we going to be finished soon?” “Yeah, I think that’s it for today.” Roger went to get the hat that he’d left on the fridge. But it wasn’t there. Suddenly, he heard screams of laughter from Leonard and the students. When he looked back at the monkey cage, he saw the two chimps holding hands and both wearing cowboy hats. He had to giggle, but at the same time he needed to know who had done it -- one of the students or Leonard. If it was Leonard that was one thing, but if it was one of the kids...well Roger didn’t want to hire someone who was another practical joker. One was enough. “So anyone want to tell me who put my hat in the monkey cage?”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive  \n   • Leonard ­– loves practical jokes, but he has an iron rule: he never repeats the same gag. Putting Roger’s new hat into the chimp cage would be an exact repeat of his earlier stunt, so it is something he would deliberately avoid.  \n   • Tom – shows no affection for animals, is in a hurry to leave for his ball-game, and openly calls the animals “stupid.”  No motive to please a chimp or to make anybody laugh.  \n   • Henry – is terrified of being yelled at, blushes and trembles whenever he thinks he might have made a mistake.  Playing a prank that was sure to be discovered would be the last thing he’d risk.  \n   • Cindy – adores animals, keeps demonstrating her knowledge, and in the chimp area specifically remarks that Charlie “looks so sad” and that he is probably “upset that he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.”  That is a clear compassionate motive: give Charlie a hat so the pair will match.\n\n2.  Opportunity  \n   • The hat was laid on top of the refrigerator inside the preparation room.  \n   • Immediately afterwards all four went through the inner door into the feeding area.  Anyone who wanted to smuggle the hat to the chimps had to (a) pick it up in those few seconds in the prep-room, and (b) carry it unnoticed into the cage – the only time they were alone with the chimps and out of Roger’s direct line of sight.  \n   • Roger was carrying the plate; Henry had just handed it to him; Tom and Cindy had their hands free.  Of those two, only Cindy had a reason to act.  \n   • Leonard was not present until everybody had already come back out; he never had access to the hat while the chimps were being fed.\n\n3.  Physical evidence / behaviour  \n   • When they re-entered the prep-room the hat had vanished and, seconds later, both chimps were wearing hats.  Therefore the hat must have travelled with the group into the cage.  \n   • Cindy’s earlier willingness to carry the heavy elephant feed shows she is comfortable picking things up quickly; lifting a hat would be trivial.  \n   • While the chimps were being fed Roger’s attention was naturally on Harriet, who ran up to him; Cindy could easily pass the hat through the bars to Charlie.  \n   • Cindy’s immediate lowering of her head when Roger confronts the group (“It was you, wasn’t it?”) is a tacit confession.\n\n4.  Logical deduction  \n   • Leonard is ruled out by his own clearly stated principle.  \n   • Henry is ruled out by personality (terrified of upsetting Roger) and by having both hands occupied with the plate until the very last second.  \n   • Tom is ruled out by lack of motive and his eagerness to get to his game; Roger himself says, “I know you weren’t behind this.”  \n   • That leaves Cindy, whose words supplied both motive and advance notice (“He looks so sad. I think he’s upset he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.”)  She also had the only unobstructed chance to pick up the hat and hand it to Charlie.  Therefore Cindy must be the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCindy, Tom, Henry, Leonard, Roger\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCindy\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Inside the chimp preparation room Roger sets his new cowboy hat on top of the refrigerator.  \n• As Roger turns to take the food tray from Henry and lead everyone into the feeding area, Cindy swiftly reaches up, grabs the hat, and tucks it behind her back (or inside her shirt).  No one notices because Henry has just succeeded in not dropping the tray and Roger is praising him.  \n• All four enter the feeding area.  Roger’s attention is on Harriet, who rushes over wearing the original old hat.  Tom is making derisive comments, Henry is anxiously watching Roger, and Leonard is still elsewhere.  \n• Cindy steps to Charlie’s side of the cage, slips the hat through the bars, and Charlie gleefully puts it on.  \n• Feeding finishes; the group exits.  Roger turns to retrieve his hat and finds it missing.  \n• Leonard arrives, sees both chimps now wearing cowboy hats and bursts out laughing along with the students.  \n• When questioned, Cindy admits she did it because she thought Charlie felt left out without a hat.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Leonard – Although a notorious prankster, he was not present during the crucial window of opportunity, and his own code forbids repeating a gag.  \n• Tom – Showed no affection for animals, wanted to leave quickly for baseball, and was under Roger’s direct observation the whole time.  No motive.  \n• Henry – Too timid to risk angering Roger, hands full until the last moment, and still in Roger’s line of sight while he fretted about being yelled at.  \n• Roger – Victim of the prank, placed the hat on the fridge himself and had no chance or reason to stage-manage the joke.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I know you never repeat the same practical joke twice.”\nHenry spoke up next. “I didn’t do it either.”\n“I didn’t think so, Henry. You were so worried I was going to yell at you, I know you wouldn’t have wanted to upset me.”\nHenry nodded.\nRoger stared at Tom. “I know you weren’t behind this.”\n“You did? How?”\n“You had a game to go to and wouldn’t have wanted anything to tie you up.”\nRoger finally looked at Cindy. “It was you, wasn’t it?”\nCindy lowered her head. “I’m sorry.”\n“But you had a good reason, didn’t you?”\nCindy nodded. “Yeah.”\nRoger smiled. “I bet it’s because you love animals and you thought Charlie was jealous because his mate had a hat. Is that right?”\n“I could see it in his eyes.”\nLater that day, Roger gave his recommendation for the summer job. It was Cindy. She was knowledgeable, co-operative, and obviously loved animals."
