      "content": "Janice Cummings was excited. As the youth director for a new church in Overland Park, Kansas, she would host the church’s first youth sleep over. The little church had been open for six months, and still, the membership was less than 100. Though for the first time, Janice felt the church was coming together as a viable congregation. This pleased her, as the Christmas season was less than a month away. The congregation had purchased an old church building on the outskirts of Overland Park. The building was constructed in the 1930s and very old fashioned by modern standards. An old cemetery behind the churchyard reminded Janice that this institution was from a different time and way of life. The building itself was square-shaped, consisting of the sanctuary with rooms and offices on either side. A small kitchen was tucked away in back of the choir area. And that was it. Tonight, Janice would supervise the youth sleep over. There would be five kids in attendance. Janelle, Heather and Allison would sleep in a classroom on the right side of the sanctuary. Justin and Josh would sleep in a different classroom, across on the left side. Janice would sleep on the couch in the pastor’s office, which was also on the left side of the sanctuary. She knew better, though, than to believe anyone would be sleeping much. Janelle Herbst, 18, was the oldest of the girls. Janelle wore a walking cast on a very painful broken ankle and could barely walk. She was in obvious pain but was determined to spend the night with her friends. Heather Guse, a serious and intense girl, was a year younger and hoped to enroll in seminary next year after graduating from high school. Heather’s lifelong dream was to follow her dad into ministry. Her father was an ordained minister and a friend of Janice’s boss, Pastor Brian Huseby. Justin Paul, 13, was the newest youth member. He seemed nervous, but Janice assumed it was because he didn’t know the older youth and, perhaps, he did not feel well. Justin had undergone sinus surgery recently and experienced discomfort in breathing. Josh Darvin, 15, was a quiet boy who never said much, though he could be rambunctious and was liked by the other kids. Allison, 17, was the mischievous one. Janice made a mental note to keep a close eye on her. At 6:00 p.m., Pastor Brian served communion in the sanctuary. The silver wine chalice and bread tray were the first gifts the new congregation had received and Pastor Brian was fiercely proud of them. They were on permanent display by the speaker’s podium. Communion was served by the intinction method – in which the sacraments are served by dipping the wafer or bread in the communal wine cup. During communion, Janice noticed that Justin had not removed his heavy coat, which was quite baggy on his thin frame. Janice and the kids prepared a snack supper at 7:00 p.m. The rest of the evening, and on until the early morning, was spent in fellowship, game playing and discussing the future of their new church. Josh was in an especially good mood and enjoyed teasing the others with his flashlight. None of the others, including Janice, had remembered to bring a flashlight and Josh wasted no opportunity to remind them of this. But, finally, the young people tired. Around 3:00 a.m., they were finally asleep. At 4:00 a.m. Janice awoke to loud snoring near her on the left side of the sanctuary. A moment later, she thought she heard a faint noise coming from the sanctuary. She suspected a mouse nosing around the communion wafers. Janice briefly considered getting up to take a look around, but knew that it was totally dark in there with no night lights of any kind. After these disruptions, she slept soundly until 8:00 a.m., when Allison woke her. Allison and the other girls had slept in the rooms opposite the boys and Janice. Allison had to cross through the sanctuary to wake Janice and noticed the communion items missing. She mentioned this to Janice after waking her. “Yeah, right,” Janice said, teasingly, remembering Allison as the free spirited one in the group. “I’m serious.” The tone in Allison’s voice told Janice that she was not joking. After checking out the altar, Allison’s claim was confirmed. Janice asked her, “Who took the communion set?” Even the leftover crackers and grape juice were missing. Allison replied, “You’re probably thinking it was me.” “Was it you?” “No, but I was up around 5:00 o’clock to go to the bathroom.” The tiny bathroom was to the right side of the front door – the side of the sanctuary where the girls spent the night. Allison would have exited her room, turned left and walked down the side aisle to the bathroom. This could be accomplished in the dark sanctuary, but with difficulty, as she pointed out. “I even stubbed my toe on the side of a pew. The lower legs are made of metal and it hurts.” Allison showed Janice the fresh, ugly bruise on her right, big toe. She added, “I wouldn’t have hurt my toe against the wall if I was feeling my way along it with my hands.” Janice thought for a moment and then told Allison. “Get everybody together. This is not funny. And I think I know who took the communion set.”",

This is the house of the Lord and everything in here belongs to Him.”\nAllison asked, “So, who do you think took it?”\nJanice gave a stern look to the guilty party, who said, “It was just a joke. I’ll put it back. But, how did you know it was me?”\nJanice looked at Allison and said, “I knew it wasn’t you. You explained to me how you got that nasty bruise on your right toe. Had you left your room and turned right towards the altar, chances are slim you would have bruised your toe that way on the wall.”\nJanice looked next at Janelle. “You didn’t take the communion set, either. You can barely move with that broken ankle. There is no way you could move about in a dark room in pain and not make a substantial noise.” Janelle nodded her head.\nLooking at Justin, Janice said, “I heard snoring just before hearing a faint noise around 4:00 o’clock. Your sinus surgery served you well this morning, Justin. Besides, I noticed you still had on your heavy coat during communion. I knew you must have been running a fever. I am confident that playing a practical joke was the last thing on your mind when going to bed.” Justin was stunned, and said nothing.\nShe said to Heather, “I know how important seminary and becoming a pastor are to you. I doubt you would jeopardize that with a practical joke such as this. Besides, joking just does not fit your personality.”\nFinally, looking at Josh, she said, “You were in a playful mood last night. You had a flashlight – the only flashlight -- and could easily see what you were doing. But, even if you were not the only one with a flashlight, I would still know it was you, because it could not be any of the others.”\nHe replied, soberly, “I didn’t mean any harm. The service is in Justin’s big coat pocket. I ate the crackers and drank the grape juice.”\nJanice thought for a moment, and then replied, softly, “And no real harm was done. But, this is the Lord’s house and He is not to be mocked.” Pausing for a moment, she continued with emphasis, “You drank the blood and ate the body of Christ out of proper context. That is wrong.”\nJosh, now visibly shaken, asked, “What are you going to do?” Janice took a moment before answering. “Nothing,” she said.\n“Nothing?” Josh asked, incredulously. He was used to harsh, unforgiving school administrators. “Why not?”\nJanice smiled a thin smile. She said, “Don’t you remember your Sunday school lessons? It was Jesus who said, “Go and sin no more.”",

Motive absent.  \n\n   Heather Guse – earnest, future seminarian, very serious, no playful streak, unlikely to mock a sacred object; also no flashlight, so movement in darkness difficult.  \n\n   Justin Paul – recovering from sinus surgery, wearing a heavy coat because of fever/chills, snoring loudly at 4:00 a.m. (Janice heard him); movement improbable and motive absent.  \n\n   Allison (only first name given) – mischievous reputation, but her statement is testable: she got up at 5:00, groped her way toward the bathroom along the side aisle, had no flashlight, and smashed the top of her right big toe against a pew leg (metal). The bruise is fresh. Had she been the thief she would have gone the opposite direction first (toward the altar) and probably kept one hand on the wall, not the pews, so the bruise would not be where it is. Story fits the physical evidence.  \n\n   Josh Darvin – playful mood all evening, enjoyed showing off his flashlight (the only one in the building). Perfect tool for quiet movement in pitch darkness. Nothing physically prevents him from walking. Ate snacks all night, so likely still hungry/thirsty. Practical-joke personality gives motive. Slept in the boys’ classroom on the same (left) side as Janice; could slip out, cross the sanctuary, remove the set, stash it in Justin’s oversized coat pocket (easy hiding place), then return. The faint noise Janice heard at 4:00 a.m. fits Josh’s movements; the loud snorer nearby was Justin, confirming Justin stayed put while someone else moved.\n\n3. Logical deduction  \n   • Eliminate Janelle (mobility).  \n   • Eliminate Justin (heard snoring; physical condition).  \n   • Eliminate Heather (motive/personality, no flashlight).  \n   • Eliminate Allison (bruise explanation; still no flashlight).  \n   • Only Josh possesses motive, means (flashlight), physical ability, and was not eliminated by independent evidence.  \n   Therefore Josh is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJanelle Herbst, Heather Guse, Justin Paul, Allison [lastname not given], Josh Darvin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJosh Darvin\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• ≈3:00 a.m. All youths try to sleep.  \n• ≈4:00 a.m. Josh, still keyed up, decides on a prank. Armed with his flashlight he slips out of the boys’ classroom.  \n  – He crosses the sanctuary, lifts the silver chalice and bread tray, plus the remaining crackers and grape juice.  \n  – He returns, hides the hardware in the large pocket of Justin’s hanging winter coat (ample space, also diverts suspicion).  \n  – He munches the crackers and downs the grape juice.  \n  – While he is moving, Janice (asleep on the couch in the pastor’s office on the same side) hears a brief, faint noise.  \n• A few seconds later Janice also hears loud snoring coming from Justin, confirming at least one boy is still in the room. She dozes off again.  \n• ≈5:00 a.m. Allison gropes her way to the bathroom. In darkness she catches her right big toe on the metal leg of a pew and bruises it. The chalice and tray are already gone.  \n• 8:00 a.m. Allison crosses the sanctuary and notices the empty altar. She wakes Janice.  \n• Group meeting: Janice eliminates each youth in turn until only Josh remains. Josh confesses, retrieves the items from Justin’s coat, and admits eating and drinking the elements.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Janelle Herbst – Severe broken ankle; could not walk about silently or without waking others.  \n• Justin Paul – Heard snoring at the key time; recent sinus surgery and fever made extra activity very unlikely; the stolen items were found hidden in his coat, planted there.  \n• Heather Guse – Strong religious conviction and serious demeanor make deliberate sacrilege improbable; lacked a flashlight, so silent movement in total darkness would be hazardous.  \n• Allison – Although mischievous, her trip to the bathroom at 5:00 a.m. was on the opposite side of the sanctuary, and her fresh toe bruise matches that account. She had no light source to navigate to the altar safely.  \nEach of these factors removes reasonable doubt for everyone except Josh, leaving him as the sole and confirmed culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "Janice explained to the kids why they had been called to a meeting. “One of you took the communion service set from the altar.” The kids gave Janice a blank look as she continued: “No doubt this is a practical joke, but I’m not amused. This is the house of the Lord and everything in here belongs to Him.”\nAllison asked, “So, who do you think took it?”\nJanice gave a stern look to the guilty party, who said, “It was just a joke. I’ll put it back. But, how did you know it was me?”\nJanice looked at Allison and said, “I knew it wasn’t you. You explained to me how you got that nasty bruise on your right toe. Had you left your room and turned right towards the altar, chances are slim you would have bruised your toe that way on the wall.”\nJanice looked next at Janelle. “You didn’t take the communion set, either. You can barely move with that broken ankle. There is no way you could move about in a dark room in pain and not make a substantial noise.” Janelle nodded her head.\nLooking at Justin, Janice said, “I heard snoring just before hearing a faint noise around 4:00 o’clock. Your sinus surgery served you well this morning, Justin. Besides, I noticed you still had on your heavy coat during communion. I knew you must have been running a fever. I am confident that playing a practical joke was the last thing on your mind when going to bed.” Justin was stunned, and said nothing.\nShe said to Heather, “I know how important seminary and becoming a pastor are to you. I doubt you would jeopardize that with a practical joke such as this. Besides, joking just does not fit your personality.”\nFinally, looking at Josh, she said, “You were in a playful mood last night. You had a flashlight – the only flashlight -- and could easily see what you were doing. But, even if you were not the only one with a flashlight, I would still know it was you, because it could not be any of the others.”\nHe replied, soberly, “I didn’t mean any harm. The service is in Justin’s big coat pocket. I ate the crackers and drank the grape juice.”\nJanice thought for a moment, and then replied, softly, “And no real harm was done. But, this is the Lord’s house and He is not to be mocked.” Pausing for a moment, she continued with emphasis, “You drank the blood and ate the body of Christ out of proper context. That is wrong.”\nJosh, now visibly shaken, asked, “What are you going to do?” Janice took a moment before answering. “Nothing,” she said.\n“Nothing?” Josh asked, incredulously. He was used to harsh, unforgiving school administrators. “Why not?”\nJanice smiled a thin smile. She said, “Don’t you remember your Sunday school lessons? It was Jesus who said, “Go and sin no more.”"
