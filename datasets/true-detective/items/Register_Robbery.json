      "content": "Carol Ludlow amazed the hospitality industry when she hired troubled teens to work at her restaurant, Desserts on Me. The restaurant took off and she felt happy that she had improved the lives of these young people. The kids didn’t always get along, but Carol thought that by showing them encouragement and kindness, she’d be setting a good example. She gave them each specific responsibilities at the restaurant. Dan was in charge of keeping the restaurant exterior clean and presentable. David, who was her newest hire, kept the kitchen clean, washing dishes and putting away supplies. Teresa was a natural when it came to baking, and Carol entrusted her with the recipes for the cakes and pies. Robert had a talent for management, and Carol often left him in charge when she went out to run errands. One Monday morning, Carol returned from one of those errand runs to find Officer Whitcomb in the dining room of the restaurant, examining her cash register. “Hello, Miss Ludlow. I’m sorry to spring this on you, but your employee Robert called in a theft. Three hundred dollars is missing from your cash register.” Carol raised her eyebrows. “Oh, dear!” “Robert said you left exactly three hundred in there this morning in case any deliveries arrived. When the dairy delivery arrived, Robert came in here to get the money and discovered it missing. He called us immediately, and I only just arrived. Robert said he can hear the front door ring from the kitchen and he didn’t hear it once, other than when I entered. The dairy delivery came to the back, as usual. There’s really only one possibility: the thief must be one of your employees.” Carol felt a lump form in her throat. “You gotta expect problems from kids like these. Sometimes they don’t know what’s right. I’ve told them all to stay in the kitchen. I’ll begin the interviews, and you can press charges when I figure out which of the troublemakers did it.” “No, no, I’ll handle it.” Carol thanked the officer and ushered him out. She told him she’d be in touch if she thought she needed his help. As he left, the door made its usual loud ringing sound. Carol walked into the kitchen to greet her employees. Robert, Teresa, David and Dan all stood silently, waiting for her to yell at them. Carol took a deep breath and said, “I know you’ve all heard about the robbery. We’ll talk about it a little later. Right now, I want to unpack the things I bought while running my errands.” Carol placed the bag of supplies she had bought onto the kitchen counter. She removed the rubber gloves from the bag and placed them into the empty glove holder. Then she took out the towels she had purchased and hung them on the racks in the kitchen. The kids had been messier than normal this week and all of the regular towels were at the cleaners. Carol walked back into the dining room and sat down at one of the tables. As she thought about the missing three hundred dollars, she felt sad. Obviously, one of her employees must have needed the money for something important. She decided she would call in the kids one by one to try to figure out who did it and why. Robert entered first. He had long brown hair and a shiny crystal stud in his ear. “So how did everything go today, Robert?” “Okay. I stayed in the kitchen all morning watchin’ Teresa make that Black Forest Cake. You know how messy she gets. I just wanted to stop her from getting batter everywhere.” “Thanks, Robert.” “I wouldn’t even let her go to the bathroom till she finished. She would have gotten batter everywhere, and I thought it was better to be sure she finished her work before she took any kind of break. The only time I left her alone was when I went out back to greet the dairy deliveryman.” “Well we’ll have to talk about the bathroom thing later, but in the meantime, why don’t you send Teresa out here?” “Sure, Miss L.” A moment later, Teresa came into the dining room, her patched-up jeans and T-shirt covered in flour. “Hi, Miss L.” She reached out to shake Carol’s hand, then looked down at her batter-covered fingers. “Sorry.” “So how are you doing, Teresa?” “Fine. Except Robert didn’t leave me alone all morning, besides going out back to greet the dairy deliveryman. He said I couldn’t go to the bathroom till I finished the cake.” She tossed her long blond hair behind her shoulders. “He kept on making jokes about me being so messy. Why does he do that?” As Teresa spoke, she gestured with her hands and flour puffed off of her clothes. She smiled sheepishly. “Sorry, again.” “That’s okay. I know you’re trying hard.” “Can I go to the bathroom now?” “Sure, honey.” Teresa nodded and rushed away. A few moments later, David entered the dining room wearing his usual baseball cap. His rake-thin body trembled as he sat beside Carol. “I had a terrible day,” he said. “Why?” asked Carol. “I forgot about my skin allergies.” David rubbed his hands. “I accidentally put on rubber gloves when I did the dishes and it made my hands swell up. I could hardly move ’em.” “How do they feel now?” “A little better, but I still can’t move them very well.” She looked at his hands. “Do you want me to call Doc Robbins?” “No, that’s okay. I’m sure they’ll be alright soon.” Carol nodded. “By the way, did Robert, Teresa or Dan talk to you today? Are they making you feel welcome?” A sullen expression appeared on David’s face as he shook his head no. Then he stood up and slowly walked back to the kitchen. Dan sauntered into the dining room next. A tall boy, he had tattoos all over his arms. “Hiya, Miss L. Did you see how amazing the front of the restaurant looks now?” “Yes, very nice, Dan. How long did it take you to clear away all the leaves?” “An hour or so. I had a very difficult time—the wind blew the leaves everywhere. But I finally did it. I’m proud of how neat and tidy it looks now.” “That’s great!” Dan walked back to join the others in the kitchen, and Carol folded her hands on her lap. As she thought about all the answers that her employees had given her, she realized that one of them had given something away. Carol knew who’d stolen the money.",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the time window  \n   • Carol put $300 in the register and left.  \n   • The only moment anyone noticed the loss was when Robert went for the money just before the dairy delivery.  \n   • Therefore the theft had to occur between Carol’s departure and Robert’s discovery.\n\n2. Who could reach the register without setting off the front-door bell?  \n   • Anyone already inside the building.  \n   • Dan, who was working outside, would have had to come in through the front door (bell would ring) or the back (kitchen) and cross the kitchen in view of the others.  \n   • Robert and Teresa were in the kitchen together the whole time, by their own mutually supporting stories.  \n   • David was also in the kitchen, but unlike Teresa he was not being watched every second (Robert concentrated on Teresa’s messiness).\n\n3. Check for physical evidence / contradictions  \n   • Teresa is covered with batter and flour and there were no towels available before Carol returned. Had she handled the register, flour smears would be on it––none were mentioned.  \n   • Robert has no contradictory statements; nothing places him near the register except the moment of discovery.  \n   • Dan’s job kept him outdoors, and the ringing door chime would have betrayed any entrance.  \n   • David claims his hands swelled because he “accidentally put on rubber gloves.”  Carol had just bought the ONLY box of gloves on her errand and placed them in the holder AFTER the theft.  Therefore, at the time David says he wore them, they did not exist.  The statement is false and purposely invented to explain the condition of his hands (swollen because he was nervously clutching cash, harsh soap, etc.).\n\n4. Motive  \n   • No motive is given for Teresa or Dan.  \n   • Robert supposedly wants to buy his girlfriend perfume, but that claim comes only from Dan (hearsay).  \n   • David confesses that his father is unemployed and he wanted to help him financially—clear motive tied directly to the stolen sum.\n\n5. Logical conclusion  \n   • Only one person both had an unsupervised moment inside, supplied a motive, and told a provable lie about circumstances: David.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRobert, Teresa, Dan, David\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nDavid\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly Monday morning Carol stocked the register with $300 for expected deliveries and then left on errands.  \nIn the kitchen Robert hovered over Teresa while she baked; Dan worked outside; David washed dishes.  \nNot watched as closely as Teresa, David slipped from the kitchen into the empty dining room and removed the entire $300 from the register.  Because he was already inside, he triggered no door chime.  He hid the cash on his person and returned to the kitchen before Robert noticed his brief absence.  \nAware that his hands were reddened and swollen—most likely from strong dish detergent—David invented a cover story. When Carol later arrived and restocked the glove holder, David assumed gloves had always been there and said he’d “accidentally put on rubber gloves,” hoping an allergic-reaction story would account for his hands and divert suspicion.  \nRobert discovered the money missing when the dairy man came; Officer Whitcomb arrived; interviews followed.  \nCarol, knowing she had only just purchased the day’s first box of gloves, spotted David’s lie at once.  Confronted, David admitted taking the money to give to his unemployed father.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Robert – His only absence from the kitchen was to greet the dairy deliveryman, a moment after which he immediately found the money gone.  Teresa corroborates that he had been with her continuously before that.  No contradictory statements or physical evidence implicate him.  \n\n• Teresa – Covered head-to-toe in batter and flour with no towels available until Carol returned.  Any contact with the register would have left obvious residue, yet the officer examined it and found none.  She was also constantly under Robert’s eye.  \n\n• Dan – Worked outside raking leaves.  Entering through the front would have rung the bell Robert says never sounded; entering through the back would have required passing through the kitchen in full view.  No one reports seeing him inside before the loss was discovered.  \n\nOnly David had motive, opportunity, and a disproved alibi, clearing the others of suspicion.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "In the kitchen, all the kids stood around arguing—except for David, who sat in the corner rubbing his hands. No one even looked at him.\n“I know who took the dough,” Dan shouted. “Robert. He said he wanted to buy his girlfriend a bottle of perfume this week.”\nTeresa shook her head. “I don’t think so. Robert and I were in the kitchen together all morning, except when he was out back with the dairy deliveryman, right before he discovered the money was missing. He may be mean, but he’s no thief.”\nDan looked at Teresa. “Are you sure you didn’t do it?”\nRobert put his hand on Teresa’s shoulder. “No way. Teresa’s messy, but she wouldn’ta stolen from Miss L. Besides, if she’d used the cash register there’d be batter and flour everywhere from her fingers and clothes. There wern’t no towels, remember?” Robert looked Dan in the face. “Maybe you did it.”\n“I didn’t. I was outside clearing leaves, and if I came in, the door would have rung—you would have heard it.”\nThe tension in the kitchen was rising. Soon all the kids were yelling at one another. A moment later, Carol entered. A hush filled the room. She smiled. “I know you’re all good kids, but sometimes some of us have problems and need a little extra help. David, I know you told a fib when you said that you had used the rubber gloves to wash the dishes. We didn’t have any.”\nAll eyes turned to David. He stood up, tears rolling down his face.\n“I’m so sorry, Miss Ludlow. I made a mistake. My dad’s unemployed right now and I wanted to give the three hundred to him.”\nAll the other employees whispered amongst themselves.\nCarol gave David a hug. “Thank you for confessing, honey. I know that was difficult.”\nDan stepped towards Carol. “Miss L, we’ve been thinking that maybe we could all put our heads together and figure out another way to help David’s dad.”\nCarol’s wide smile lit up the room."
