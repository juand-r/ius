      "content": "I got the call from an excited Lawrence Horton at about 1:30 on Monday afternoon. Horton, an old movies fan, is the owner of The Blue Parrot Restaurant, which is not far from the newspaper where I work, for too little money, as Food and Wine Editor. “Come right over. I need your help. Right now! Before this news gets all over town.” He sounded desperate, like a heart attack ready to happen. I raced down the street and was there within a few minutes. Horton waved me into his office, and introduced me to a patron, William Saunders. “Yes,” Saunders said, “I read your column. You know your food and wines. So you’ll appreciate that I don’t like paying hundreds of dollars for what I did not order! My wife Caroline and I were celebrating our anniversary. We ordered a special meal, steaks with black mushrooms. That’s what we got. But when I checked the credit card, it was for the truffles, at three times the cost of the meal we actually had! We came here on your recommendation, too!” That made it personal. I was startled. After all, I had just run a special article on The Blue Parrot, which featured this very dish. Truffles were rare and expensive. I had never tried the black truffles from France or the equally expensive and rare white ones from Italy. That is, I had never tried them before the special tasting Mr. Horton set up before my column. He had an order, and so did I. Their cost was high -- reaching $1,500 a pound. These truffles grew randomly underground, and were difficult to find. They were usually found by specially trained dogs, or even pigs, which traced the truffle scent! They gave food an unforgettable flavor, rich with a touch of garlic. So tasting the real thing was a rare event, and charging for it without serving the dish was grand larceny. “Show me where this happened,” I said. “And please try to keep the noise down,” Horton added. “This’ll get sorted out, I’m sure,” he added, trying to reassure both Saunders and himself. “Believe me, you won’t have to pay for anything that you didn’t order.” Saunders shook his head in an I-told-you-so affirmation. I turned to Horton. “I want to see everyone involved in the service.” Horton summoned the waiter, Antoine, and the head waiter, Georges Monceau. “What is the serving procedure?” My question was directed at the headwaiter, who was also in charge of wines. Monceau answered crisply. Clearly he was a man who knew his business. “I deliver the menus, both the wine and also the food menu, if Sally Horvats has not already done so. I then offer to be of any assistance. Sometimes I even get the orders, when there is a rush. Actually, Mr. Saunders is a very knowledgeable consumer, and something of a wine authority in his own right. He will sometimes check with me about a special dish or a vintage year. But this was a special occasion. He had already made up his mind that he wanted the steak with black mushroom sauce, and he ordered it and was served promptly, so no special assistance was needed from me.” Saunders nodded in agreement. “What happened then?” Antoine answered: “I gave the order to the chef, Sam Wheeler, and when the order was ready, I served it immediately to the customer.” Monceau nodded in agreement. “Then, I opened and served his wine, after the customer checked the label. After that, I would check back from time to time, to see if everything was all right. It seemed to be, and Mr. Saunders left his typical generous cash tip. Though, he was in a hurry to leave when he finished his meal. He just picked up his credit card and left.” Antoine smiled in agreement. We all went into the kitchen. Horton introduced us to Sam Wheeler, a beefy man wearing a large, white chef’s apron and cap. “Tell us about the truffle service,” I said. “Just take us through your routine.” Sam Wheeler grunted a bit. “Those are special orders,” he began. “By that, I mean that each is cooked to order, never prepared in advance. Truffles are not cooked very long. If they were, they might lose some of the flavor that the customer is paying such a premium for,” he said.\n\t\n“Show me the truffles.”\n\t\nHe pointed to a medium-sized jar. I picked it up. It was a French import from a famous and respected shipping house. “We had just two jars,” he said, pointing to a hall-full jar: “I cook in front of the entire staff, they know we used one jar last week, and this is what remains from the second jar -- after three orders today. We’ll run out entirely soon.” “How many orders can you make per jar?” “ … About six.” “Do you get many orders for steak with black mushrooms?” “Sure, plenty of them. It’s something of a specialty here. A good dish, certainly. But not the same as steak and truffles!” “Have you cooked truffles before?” I asked. He bristled a bit, but admitted that he had seen it done when he was in culinary school, but had never before done it himself. They were just too expensive for student chefs to handle. “Could there be a mistake, with one dish ordered and the wrong one served?” “Absolutely not,” he said. “Also, I never serve the two together in the same dish. If the customer ordered steak with truffle sauce, and got mushrooms instead, there has been either a mistake or a crime.” They were stunned. We left the kitchen, and Antoine and Georges Manceau went back to their stations. Saunders left, somewhat pacified that the matter was being closely investigated. I took Horton aside and asked to see the daily receipts. He introduced Sally Horvats, the hostess who doubled as cashier. A troubled-looking brunette, she came over at Horton’s nod. “No, I really didn’t see anything,” she said. “It was a busy day, and there was just time to seat Mr. and Mrs. Saunders and give them their food menus. And then some more customers appeared at the front door, and I had to go and greet them.” She was nervous, and I remembered why. Horton had told me that she was on parole for petty larceny. He was giving her a chance to redeem herself, a chance that, over the last six months, had seemed justified. “That’s right,” Horton said. “She was on duty all last week, but couldn’t have been at any table more than a couple of minutes.” A new thought came to me. “How about the day’s receipts, Mr. Horton? And last week’s too, while you’re at it.” We went to his office. Everything seemed to be in order. There were three orders for today, and six orders of the special truffled steaks for last week, including the order for the Saunders luncheon, and there were also six credit card duplicates for those orders. “So it was just a mistake after all,” Horton said. “This proves it.” I thought for a minute. “No, Mr. Horton. It was grand larceny. I know who switched the orders,” I said.",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What was the crime?  \n   A customer ate the ordinary “steak with black-mushroom sauce” but his credit-card was run through for the far more costly “steak with truffles.”\n\n2. Where could the switch have been made?  \n   • In the kitchen – by putting the wrong sauce on the meat.  \n   • In the dining-room – by the waiter bringing the wrong plate.  \n   • At the cash desk – by ringing up a different entrée from the one eaten.\n\n3. Could the kitchen be at fault?  \n   • Chef Sam cooks truffle dishes in front of the whole staff.  \n   • He never puts truffles and ordinary mushrooms on the same plate, so a visual mistake is impossible; any waiter would immediately see black mushroom sauce instead of slices of truffle.  \n   • Three truffle orders were prepared Monday; Saunders’ plate would have been a fourth. The jar, however, is half-full (three of the six portions gone). Therefore no fourth truffle order left the kitchen. So the kitchen can be ruled out.\n\n4. Could the waiter or headwaiter be at fault?  \n   • Antoine merely carried the plate. No fourth truffle plate exists; he could not serve what did not leave the kitchen.  \n   • Head-waiter Georges came only to open the wine.\n\n5. What happens at the cash desk?  \n   • Saunders signed for his lunch and hurried out.  \n   • Sally, the hostess/cashier, runs the credit cards. She is the only person who physically possesses the customer’s card and the charge slips after the diner leaves.  \n   • She is on parole for petty larceny – a motive (easy money) and a record.\n\n6. Inventory/receipt discrepancy  \n   • One full jar (6 portions) was used up the previous week.  \n   • But two of those portions were the complimentary tasting for Horton and for the narrator.  \n   • Therefore only four paying customers could have been charged last week, yet six credit-card slips for truffle dishes were in the till.  \n   • Someone ran two completely fictitious truffle charges last week, and Monday tried it again with Saunders.\n\n7. Who had the chance to do all of those extra charges? Only the cashier.\n\nHence Sally Horvats is the one person who had motive, means, and opportunity and whose actions fit every discrepancy.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSam Wheeler, Antoine, Georges Monceau, Sally Horvats\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nSally Horvats\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Last week Chef Wheeler used one full jar of truffles (six servings). Two of those servings went to free tastings for Mr. Horton and the narrator, so only four should have appeared on paying customers’ bills.  \n• While processing credit-card slips, Sally slipped in two additional “steak with truffle” charges and pocketed the difference between that price and the real, cheaper dishes the customers had eaten.  \n• On Monday three genuine truffle orders were cooked, leaving half a jar – exactly what the kitchen inventory shows.  \n• When William Saunders brought up his card, Sally again substituted a truffle charge slip for his legitimate mushroom-steak slip, confident that a well-dressed, generous tipper would not scrutinise the bill until later.  \n• Saunders did check, complained, and the investigation began.  \n• Kitchen inventory proves no fourth truffle order existed; waiter and headwaiter never handled a truffle plate for Saunders.  \n• Receipt totals show two phantom truffle sales from the previous week.  \n• Confronted with these facts, Sally’s scheme is uncovered, landing her back in prison.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nSam Wheeler – Inventory proves he cooked exactly three truffle dishes Monday; no extra order left the kitchen, so Saunders could not have been served truffles by mistake.  \nAntoine – He delivered whatever plate was ready; because no truffle plate for Saunders existed, he could not have swapped anything.  \nGeorges Monceau – Only opened the wine; never handled either the food or the bill.  \nLawrence Horton (owner) and the narrator – Had no access to the cash register and, in fact, were the ones defrauded by the phantom truffle charges for their complimentary tastings.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "Sam Wheeler made the truffle dish in plain sight of the kitchen and staff. Truffles and black mushrooms were never on the same dish. A waiter seeing an error would have pointed it out to the chef.\nAntoine the waiter had no opportunity to switch truffles for black mushrooms. He merely picked up the plate and delivered it promptly to the customer. Georges Monceau, the head waiter, never touched the order.\nSally Horvats, the cashier, is guilty. She was in charge of processing credit card charges. She recognized a rich repeat customer, and thought that he would not notice that he was billed for the more expensive meal, when she switched a credit card charge for the actual one that he had signed, putting it through after he had left the restaurant.\nThere were six orders served the previous week, from the full jar of truffles that was used up. Two of them however were served to Mr. Horton, the restaurant owner, and to the narrator. Therefore, only four orders should have been charged. The two further orders that were charged to the Saunders credit card by Sally Horvats were her attempt to make some easy money. Her scheme landed her back in prison instead."
