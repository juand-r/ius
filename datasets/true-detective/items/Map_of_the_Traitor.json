      "content": "The sun rose as George Washington rode by – tall, proud, and respected by his men. Nate rode slowly towards him, delivering an important message from the Virginia militia. In the woods, an owl hooted as the American soldiers passed on their horses, disturbing its sleep. It was early on a hot morning in July, 1780. “The British would split our army into two smaller pieces,” General Washington was saying. “But they can't! They can't travel up the river, since we've fortified the fort at West Point.” Bright sunshine sparkled on a lake as Nate approached with his message. Like everyone, Nate revered General Washington. Nearly 6,000 British soldiers had surrendered to Washington's troops at the battle of Saratoga three years earlier. But now Nate was bringing the General bad news, and as his horse clomped up the muddy farmland road, he nervously hoped that it wouldn't make his leader angry. As Nate approached, he recognized the famous general from his blue coat and three-cornered hat. “What's your name?” the general asked. “Jate Nackson,” he said nervously. “I mean, Nate Jackson.” General Washington smiled and asked if the Virginia militia was sending more troops. “Only 200, sir.” Nate saw little hint of disappointment in the general's face. It seemed Washington's success always depended on his strategy, not his resources. But suddenly, they spotted a messenger galloping towards them on a white horse. “Sir!” the messenger shouted. “The British are planning to attack our West Point fort tonight.” “But how?” “A traitor has given them a detailed map!” General Washington was alarmed, and asked for more information. Panting for breath, the messenger told his story: “It was midnight in the woods when the British major received the map,” he said quickly. “The major hid the map in his boot and disguised himself in American clothing, traveling all night on a secret path through the woods.” A worried silence fell over the group of soldiers. “As the sun rose, he was spotted making his escape on foot. And he's traveling down this very road!” General Washington turned suddenly to Nate. “Did you spend this morning riding towards us on this road?” Nate nodded quickly. “Then you must've passed the British major. We can still capture him – if we know what he looks like!” “But General,” Nate stammered, “I passed four men on the road! Any one of them could've been the British major in disguise.” He hated to disappoint General Washington again, but unfortunately, it was the truth. “There's only one thing to do,” the messenger said. “The fate of the American army depends on it, and maybe the fate of America itself. We must identify and capture the British major – and fast.” Within minutes, Nate was galloping down the road with some of General Washington's best soldiers. But could they locate the traitor's map? Suddenly, they spotted the first traveler on the road. Nate remembered seeing this man. He was traveling fast, and wearing a heavy cotton shirt. “Good morning,” the soldiers called out. “What's good about it?” the old man complained. “This heat brings mosquitoes. I only hope I don't catch a disease!” Sweat had soaked his shirt, and mud covered his humble trousers and bare feet. The soldiers laughed politely at the man's obvious discomfort. The man said his name was Edward, and that he'd been farming the land along the road for 15 years. “And I still don't like this weather!” “Look!” said Nate, pointing to another traveler, just a half mile up the road. They had barely noticed him, since his brown shirt blended with the mud around him. Leaving two soldiers to bring Edward behind them, Nate galloped quickly towards the figure with the rest of the soldiers. They discovered a young man in a thin brown shirt and leather vest. He glared at the soldiers as they arrived, and seemed uninterested in their mission. When they asked him where he was headed, he replied: “What business is it of yours?” He seemed like the wealthy son of a merchant. “What's your name?” Nate asked politely. “Lucius,” he said, sullenly, but he was clearly angry with the soldiers. “How old are you?” “Seventeen, and I hope the British beat your army,” he declared, “and soon!” “You're supporting the British?\" Nate asked. “Lots of people do,” Lucius replied. “About one out of every six people is supporting the British. War disrupts trading. I may be only a teenager, but I know that trading is what feeds my family!” Nate could understand his bitterness. With two soldiers escorting Lucius, the men rode on. The sun was getting even hotter as they passed a wide field of wheat. But soon, far ahead, they spotted a cloud of dust on the road. Nate and the soldiers galloped faster towards the cloud, discovering it came from a trotting grey horse and its shaggy-haired rider. The man's clothes were covered with dust, which had even dirtied his long, shaggy hair. “My name's Benjamin,” the man said. “Can I help you?” he asked politely. Nate was pleased that Benjamin was much more friendly than the last traveler they'd met. Benjamin said he planned to travel the road all the way to Charleston so he could visit his nephew. “It's a long way, but I figured I'd take my time,” he laughed. “I'm going just until I can find a shady tree to eat lunch under!” It did sound like a reasonable plan. But when Nate looked down the road ahead, he thought he'd spotted the fourth traveler. Leaving two soldiers behind, Nate and the others rode their horses up the road. They were soon greeted by a young man in his twenties, walking slowly down the road. Nate eyed him suspiciously, but the man seemed friendly enough. “Hello!” he said as Nate approached. “My name's Nate.” “Well, my name's Jonathan!” He extended his hand for a hearty handshake. Jonathan had short, yellow hair, and he shielded his eyes as he looked up at Nate. The midday sun was bright, as it was now nearly noon; but Jonathan's eyes were also red, and lined with dark circles. Jonathan said he was traveling to the Virginia coast, where he hoped to find work as a sailor. “It's a hard road to travel,” said Jonathan. “But an honest road.” Nate sat on his horse, thinking about the four travelers they'd met. The American army might be destroyed unless he determined which traveler was secretly a major in the British army. As the soldiers gathered the suspects, his eyes lit up with excitement, “I know who has the traitor's map!”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  What do we know about the British major?\n   •  He received a detailed map at midnight and has been “traveling all night on a secret path.”   \n   •  He is “in American clothing,” so nothing about his dress will openly betray him.  \n   •  The messenger saw him “making his escape on foot.”  \n   •  He “hid the map in his boot.”  \n   •  Having walked without sleep since midnight, he is almost certainly exhausted – red-rimmed, shadowed eyes are to be expected.\n\n2.  Compare each of the four men Nate met with those facts.\n\n   Edward – the barefoot farmer  \n      –  Bare feet mean no boots → nowhere to hide the map.  \n      –  A simple local who has farmed there for 15 years; not the profile of a British major.  \n      –  Although he is on foot, he fails the critical “boot” requirement.\n\n   Lucius – the angry 17-year-old merchant’s son  \n      –  Only seventeen → too young to be a major.  \n      –  Admits his British sympathy openly.  A real spy would conceal that.  \n      –  No indication of physical exhaustion or red eyes.  \n      –  No explicit mention of boots either.\n\n   Benjamin – the shaggy-haired horseman  \n      –  He is riding a horse, yet the major was seen on foot.  \n      –  A horse kicks up a large trail of dust – hardly a good way for a spy to keep hidden.  \n      –  A rider could not easily have slipped past Nate earlier, because Nate also rode a horse and would have remembered another rider.\n\n   Jonathan – the blond young man in his twenties  \n      –  Traveling on foot, exactly as reported.  \n      –  Boots are specifically mentioned when the soldiers later search him.  \n      –  Bloodshot, dark-circled eyes – matches someone who has not slept since midnight.  \n      –  Age fits a possible major’s rank.  \n      –  Tries to appear friendly and ordinary but becomes frightened and runs when the soldiers close in.\n\n   Only Jonathan matches every single criterion.\n\n3.  Physical evidence  \n   When Jonathan is captured, the map is found in his boot together with Benedict Arnold’s treasonous letter – direct, conclusive proof.\n\n4.  Motive & opportunity  \n   The letter shows his motive (co-operating with Benedict Arnold to hand over West Point).  \n   He alone had both opportunity (on the same road as Nate, on foot, unslept) and the necessary means (boots to conceal the map).\n\nTherefore, Jonathan is the British major in disguise.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nEdward, Lucius, Benjamin, Jonathan\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJonathan (alias: British Major in American dress)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAround midnight a British major met with his American contact in the woods and was handed a detailed plan of the West Point fort.  He slipped the parchment into one of his boots, changed into plain American clothing, and hurried off on a forest path.  He travelled all night, afraid to use a horse for fear of being recognised, and by dawn reached the main road where Nate Jackson happened to ride past him without taking notice.\n\nExhausted, red-eyed, and still on foot, he continued south along the same road, hoping to meet a British patrol or reach an arranged pickup point.  Shortly after midday General Washington’s detachment, guided by Nate, intercepted every traveller on that stretch of road.  The major—calling himself “Jonathan”—tried to look harmless but panicked when he saw the soldiers tightening their cordon and attempted to flee.  He was surrounded, searched, and the map and Arnold’s incriminating letter were recovered, foiling the planned betrayal of West Point.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nEdward – barefoot, hence no hiding place for a map in a boot; decades-long local farmer, not a British officer, and shows no sign of a sleepless night beyond ordinary heat discomfort.\n\nLucius – admittedly pro-British but only 17, clearly not a major; his open hostility to the rebels is the opposite of clandestine behaviour; nothing indicates lack of sleep or possession of a map.\n\nBenjamin – on horseback, contradicting the witness statement that the spy was on foot; a horseman would have been easy for Nate to remember passing; no visible fatigue consistent with marching all night.\n\nOnly Jonathan meets every descriptive element (on foot, wearing boots, obvious fatigue, age suitable for a major) and is caught with the map in his boot, making the other three men innocent.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

He's too young to be a major in the British army!”\n“I thought Edward looked suspicious,” another soldier suggested, “since he kept trying to remind us how long he'd been farming.”\n“He's a hard-working farmer,” Nate replied, “and besides, he's traveling in his bare feet. The messenger who warned us said that our British major tucked the map into his boot.”\n“Perhaps the third traveler, Benjamin, isn't really traveling to Charleston,” another soldier suggested, “and instead of a shady tree, he's galloping straight towards his British commander!”\n“But he was riding a horse,” Nate pointed out. “Our British major has been traveling by foot, according to the messenger. And, in fact, he told us that the major has been traveling since midnight, with no time for sleeping. I bet he's tired now, and he's got bloodshot eyes surrounded by dark circles.”\nHe pointed the men towards Jonathan, who ran as he saw the soldiers approaching. But the men on horseback quickly surrounded him, searched his boots, and discovered the map to the fort. They also discovered a letter he'd received from an American general named Benedict Arnold.
