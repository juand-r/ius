      "content": "Specialist Fourth Class (SP/4) Tom White had been in country for 10 months in February, 1970 and looked forward to rotating back to CONUS (the military’s term for Continental United States) in April. Tom, a U.S. Army combat engineer, had been through many experiences in those 10 months. In addition to the constant threat of Viet Cong guerillas and the capable and dangerous North Vietnamese Army, he had survived a serious bout of amoebic dysentery and a nasty case of ringworm, as well as the filthy living conditions and lack of sleep, which most field enlisted men suffered. Tom was tired and run down, but had weathered the worst that Vietnam had to offer. One afternoon in late February, a box from his uncle arrived in company headquarters. In it, Tom found a large can of commercially packaged multi-flavored popcorn. He was delighted with the unexpected gift. He looked forward to eating the popcorn, but first, he had to go upstairs for guard duty. The guard tower was on top of the semi-underground bunker his squad lived in, or hooch, as such quarters were called. The hooch sat right up on the perimeter of the base camp with the concertina fence barely 10 feet away from the half buried rear wall. Guard duty was split into two-hour shifts, beginning at 1900 hours (7:00 p.m.) and ending at 0700 hours (7:00 a.m.). Tonight, Tom was on from 1900 until 2100 hours. Guard duty on this night was uneventful. From high in the guard tower, he could see everything in front of him and everything in back on his side of the base camp. During his shift, he saw Henson head out toward the NCO club on the other side of the compound. Henson had with him only the sidearm pistol he was allowed as a non-commissioned officer. Mac walked towards the recreation area, carrying a duffel bag of baseballs and bats used during pickup games. Locke, the last to leave, walked away from the squad’s area with his M-16 rifle, but Tom could not tell where he went. He lost sight of him when a rice farmer and his water buffalo got too close to the wire directly below him. Tom’s relief arrived right at 2100 and Tom climbed down the ladder he had helped build several months before to enter the hooch. The tropical sun was just going down and he thought about how hot it could be in Vietnam at any time of day — even as late as midnight. But Tom’s focus turned quickly to the memory of the popcorn his Uncle Ross had sent. He planned to munch on it while writing a letter home. Entering the hooch and walking to his bunk, Tom noticed the can of popcorn missing. He also noticed water on the floor. There were a few kernels of the cheese flavored scattered in the aisle. The hooch was unusually clean as there were no empty soft drink or beer cans lying around. He also saw his buddies, Mosier, Henson, Macnamara and Locke, huddled close to his bunk with sheepish expressions on their faces. He thought it odd that they were back in the hooch on a hot evening at 2100. Annoyed, he asked, “Come on! What have you guys done with my popcorn?” Locke, the newest member of the squad, said simply, “I haven’t seen it.” Macnamara answered calmly, “Last I saw it, it was by your bunk.” Henson, Tom’s best friend, said nothing. And Mosier looked down at his feet, avoiding eye contact with Tom altogether. These fellows were all good friends and had been through a lot together. Tom did not believe they had been mean-spirited in taking his popcorn. One or all of them had given into the temptation of the moment, and had taken the opportunity to enjoy some stateside snack food. Tom White couldn’t blame them, and so, he was not angry. However, he did want to know the truth. The guys were being coy with him, and he realized this was now a game they were playing. “OK, guys. If I figure this out, will the guilty one admit it?” They men all grinned and agreed. Henson, with beer on his breath, belched, “Tom, it was only one of us that took your popcorn. He’s already been dressed down and will return what is left of it with an apology – after you figure out which of us took it, that is.” Tom, smirking, began thinking out loud, “OK, then. I brought the package down here from the mail office just before evening chow. Then we all went to chow before I headed directly up to the guard tower. So, one of you took it while I was on guard duty.” “So far, so good,” Macnamara replied. “OK, Mac, what did you do after chow?” “… Wrote a letter home, and then went to play ball with B squad.” “Locke, how about you?” “I went to the other side of the camp to watch the movie.” There was always an outdoor movie, at night, down by the enlisted men’s and NCO clubs. Tom White did not think late night movies were a wise idea, and he was proven right a few weeks earlier when the Viet Cong zeroed in on the movie screen after dark, and dropped a dozen mortars into the assembled audience. Tom though it odd that Locke took his M-16 with him to the movie, but knew that, as the newest member of the squad, he was still nervous about being in a war zone. He said nothing about seeing him with his rifle. Instead, he asked, “What did you see? Locke replied, Buena Sera, Mrs. Campbell. White looked the new man over. He knew that Gina Lollobrigida starred in that film and was one of the G.I.’s favorites. He looked over to his good buddy Henson. “Ron, how about you?” Ron answered, “I had a couple of beers down at the club.” Tom nodded, and turned to Dicky, “Mosier, what’s your story?” “I went to the showers. I washed my clothes.” Tom replied, “That’s it?” Mosier answered, “That’s it.” Tom looked at his guilty buddy. He smiled and the guilty buddy did, too. He asked modestly, “Well … did you eat it all?”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Everyone in the squad, half-starved for anything that tasted of home, would have been tempted by a big tin of flavoured popcorn.  \n   • No one showed personal animosity toward Tom, so the motive is simple temptation/opportunity, not malice.\n\n2. Opportunity & alibis during Tom’s guard shift (19:00-21:00)  \n   • Macnamara – seen from the tower walking to the recreation field carrying bats and balls; Tom kept him in sight all the way.  \n   • Henson – said he went to the NCO club for beer. Tom later smells the beer on his breath; the club is on the far side of the camp, away from the hooch.  \n   • Mosier – said he took a shower and washed clothes. Floor is still wet and his damp clothes are hanging outside the porthole, matching his story.  \n   • Locke – claimed he went “to watch the movie” on the other side of the camp and even carried his M-16.\n\n3. Physical / timing clues  \n   • It is still daylight when Tom comes off the tower (“the tropical sun was just going down”).  \n   • Outdoor movies cannot be shown until it is dark enough to project onto the screen. Therefore no one could have been “watching the movie” between 19:00 and 21:00.  \n   • Popcorn tin is gone; kernels (cheese-flavoured) are on the floor near Tom’s bunk.  \n   • Empty tin is later admitted to be behind the hooch with Mosier’s clothes.\n\n4. Deduction  \n   • Locke is the only man whose alibi is provably false—the movie could not yet have begun.  \n   • A false alibi points to guilt: he stayed near the hooch, took the popcorn, shared or ate it, then hid the can.  \n   • Macnamara, Henson and Mosier each have evidence corroborating their stories, none of which conflicts with what Tom observed from the tower.\n\nHence Locke is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nDonald “Mac” Macnamara, Ron Henson, Richard “Dicky” Mosier, (PFC) Locke\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLocke\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter evening chow, Tom went directly up to the perimeter tower for the 19:00-21:00 guard shift, leaving his newly arrived tin of popcorn on his bunk.  \nMacnamara headed for the recreation field and stayed there.  \nHenson walked to the NCO club and drank a couple of beers.  \nMosier went to the showers, scrubbed himself and his clothes, and came back dripping, hanging his wet laundry outside the porthole.  \nLocke, tempted by the popcorn, waited until the hooch was momentarily empty, took the tin, opened it, and helped himself (perhaps sharing a little with the others when they drifted back). Realising Tom would be off-duty at 21:00, he hid the now-empty tin behind the hooch among Mosier’s wet clothes and invented an alibi: “I went to watch the movie.”  \nWhen Tom confronted the squad, Locke repeated that lie, but Tom instantly spotted the flaw: with the sun only just setting, the open-air movie could not yet have started. Locke’s impossible timetable exposed him as the only person who needed to invent a cover story—therefore, the popcorn thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Macnamara was continuously visible from the guard tower en route to—and at—the ball field. He never returned near the hooch while Tom was on duty.  \n• Henson’s beer breath corroborates his trip to the club; the club is too far away for him to have dashed back, stolen the popcorn, and returned unnoticed.  \n• Mosier’s wet footprints, water on the floor, and freshly washed clothes hanging outside fit his shower story and provide no connection to the missing popcorn (the empty tin was stashed there by Locke, not Mosier).  \nBecause their stories match physical evidence and Tom’s own observations, none of them needed to lie—unlike Locke, whose only-possible-after-dark movie alibi proved false.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "“How did you know it was me?”\nTom was still chuckling. “Well, I know it wasn’t Mac. The recreation area is easily visible from the tower and I saw him walk over there with the balls and bats.”\nTom paused a moment before continuing. “I also know it wasn’t Henson. I can smell the beer on his breath from here!”\nBy now, Tom was chuckling but he continued his discourse. “Mosier did exactly what he said he did. He took a shower and washed his clothes. He must have just returned when I came down from guard. There was still water on the floor when I came in. No doubt they dripped some before he hung them outside the porthole to dry.”\nLocke said, sheepishly, “Yeah, you got me. The empty can is in back of the hooch with Mosier’s clothes. I’m sorry, man. I’ll make it up to you. I would like to know how you figured it out.”\nTom liked Locke. He had been in country only a month but he was a square guy and his promotion to PFC was expected anytime. He said to him, “You lied about the movie.”\nLocke said, “But Buena Sera, Mrs. Campbell IS on tonight!”\nTom slapped Locke playfully on the shoulder and said, “Yeah, I know, but it should be just starting. You cannot watch outdoor films until it’s dark outside.”"
