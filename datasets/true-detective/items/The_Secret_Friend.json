      "content": "Fred Foy’s wife passed away last year, leaving Fred a widower at age 65. Fred was grateful that his closest friends continued to include him in their social gatherings. So, it was at breakfast one morning at a local pancake house that Fred shared something with the Bakers and Cokers he had never shared with anyone. Retrieving an object from his pocket, he began to speak, “You four are our closest friends (Fred always spoke as if Bumps, his pet name for his wife, was still with them). It’s time to clear out some old business. I should’ve done this last year when Bumps passed away. I wish to show you this.” He opened his large hand and showed them what he had fished out of his pocket. It was a large, old-fashioned skeleton key. The five of them studied it in silence for several awkward moments. The key was impressive. Almost six inches long and plated with dullish gold, it was surprisingly light in weight. It was scratched in several places and was obviously very old. However, one of the friends knew its significance and what Fred was about to say. As if reading the mind of the “guilty” person, Fred continued, “As you know, our daughter Sarah died of leukemia in December of 1980, just before Christmas. That hurt has never gone away. It’s worse than losing Bumps last year.” Losing 12-year-old Sarah had thrown Fred and his wife into long bouts with depression. But, he continued, “A couple of years before her death, Sarah and Bumps found a large, old-fashioned door knob at a flea market and Bumps bought it for Sarah. It took me almost a week to get it installed on her bedroom door.” The memory of this brought a faint smile to Fred’s lips, “Now, I know there are two keys to the lock and I only have one. One of you has the other.” “What makes you think so, and why is it important?” asked Bill. “Because one of you was Sarah’s secret friend. She gave you the key. During the last few weeks of her life, it gave her great comfort to have such a bond with an adult person.” Fred stopped for a moment to let his words sink in. “Besides, the holder of the other key did some unusual things. After she died, several times when Bumps and I were away, you entered her room and left messages. We always kept her door locked, because Sarah felt secure when she locked herself in her room. Among other things, we learned that a scholarship had been funded in her name, a memorial stone was placed in her honor at church and the expenses for her funeral had been made by, as the funeral home director told us, “an anonymous benefactor and holder of the key.” Fred paused to look at his friends and stated simply, “It is time that I look whoever has the key in the eye and thank you properly for all three of us.” Nobody said a word until Lyn asked, “How did the person with the key get into your house?” Long ago, the Bakers, Cokers and Foys all traded house keys. It made it easy for them to check on one another’s homes when any of the families happened to be away. Fred smiled, “Perhaps you have forgotten that all of us have keys to each of our three homes.” Midge asked, “So, who do you think has the key?” Fred answered, “I don’t know.” Looking at his friends, he added, “If you won’t own up to it, perhaps you will allow me to ask a few questions.” “Ask away,” said Bill, as Harold nervously wiped his glasses with a red pocket cloth. Fred responded, “First, let me explain some things. We noticed the key missing about a month before Sarah passed on. At first, we thought she had hidden it. But a week before her death she said, “I gave it to one of your friends. I have a secret friend now.” We didn’t think anything of this until the messages began to show up in her room – a room we always kept locked in her honor, unless we were in there to clean and dust. Now, one time we found a cigarette lighter on the floor. Another time a piece of tissue paper and still another time, a Robert’s Book Store business card. We also noticed the handwritten notes were written in an awkward script. That could be a clue or not, as the writer may have intentionally disguised his or her writing style.” Fred paused to catch his breath as the waitress poured fresh cups of coffee. Fred nodded and turned to Bill, “So, what do you have to say for yourself?” “You know I am a smoker, but I’ve always used matches. I’m not Sarah’s secret friend, but would have liked to have been.” Harold flashed a smile of appreciation to his old friend, but he knew that somebody was still hiding the truth. He said to Lyn, “Tell me why you cannot be Sarah’s friend?” “Well, for one thing – I didn’t know you had a key to my house … I also didn’t know that we had a key to your house.” Turning to her husband, he asked “Harold, have you ever been a smoker?” Fred could not recall ever seeing Harold smoke in all the years he had known him, but realized that really didn’t count for much. Harold answered, “Yes, but I quit early, before meeting you and Darlene. My allergies just will not tolerate it.” Finally, Fred looked again at Midge and asked, “It seems to me that I recall you were a smoker.” “I was,” she admitted, but that was a long time ago.” “How long ago?” “Can’t remember for sure, but Ronald Reagan was president.” Fred didn’t need to ask more questions. He knew who his daughter’s secret friend was.",

Thank you so much from all of us. Do you still have the key?”\nSarah’s friend was very moved and answered, “Yes, do you want it back?” Before Fred could answer, she asked, “How did you figure it out? It’s been a secret all these years.”\nFred said, “No, keep the key. I am certain Sarah would wish for you to have it. As for your other question, well, I didn’t think too much about it until Bumps died, then it began to play in my mind. I’ve wondered how much time I have left to thank a very kind and generous friend. But, I digress. In speaking with all four of you at the same time, it wasn’t too hard to sort this out, although I was frustrated at first. As I asked questions, I eliminated those who claimed not to have the items left in Sarah’s room.” Fred paused a moment for dramatic effect.\nHe continued, “I eliminated Bill because he does not use a lighter. I have no way of knowing if he was ever a customer of Robert’s Book Store or used paper tissue, but he proved to us that he uses matches. In Lyn’s case, she told us she did not know about the spare house key in Bill’s possession.”\nFred paused again, emotion catching up with him. “I wasn’t sure of Harold. But, he told us he quit smoking before we met him and I believe it. I’ve never seen him with a cigar or cigarette.”\nMidge said, “So why me? I’ve answered everything truthfully.”\nFred grinned, “I know, but you made a mistake.”\n“It was your comment concerning smoking. You said you quit sometime while Ronald Reagan was president. President Reagan took office in January of 1981. President Carter was still in office when Sarah passed away in December, 1980.”\nMidge stared at Fred with an incredulous look on her face. Softly, she said, “I forgot about President Carter. Well, you’re probably all wondering about Robert’s Book Store. Robert Ellingwood is my brother. The store went out of business shortly after Sarah died. The tissue was mine, too. … Guess I would not be a very good burglar – or historian.”\nFred smiled and said to her, “Bumps, Sarah and I owe you a debt that can never be repaid. I have learned some very important things about you today.”\nMidge returned his grin and replied, “The first is obvious. What are the others?\n“That you are kind hearted and do our Lord’s good work in secret, but that you also have a very poor memory and a tendency to lose things.”\nLaughter from Fred’s table could be heard throughout the large pancake house.",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Someone obviously loved Sarah deeply, wanted to comfort her in her last weeks and later spared Fred and Bumps many expenses.  \n   • Such a person would have a soft, maternal disposition and be willing to act “in secret.” Midge, the only mother present, fits that emotional profile best.\n\n2. Opportunity  \n   • All four adults possessed a spare key to the Foy house, so any of them could have entered while Fred and Bumps were away.  \n   • Therefore opportunity alone does not narrow the field; we must examine the physical traces left behind.\n\n3. Physical evidence found in Sarah’s locked bedroom  \n   a) A cigarette lighter  \n   b) A tissue (hand-kerchief)  \n   c) A business card from Robert’s Book Store  \n   d) Notes written in disguised handwriting  \n\n4. The interrogatory clues  \n   • Bill admits he smokes but “always uses matches.” If that is true, the lighter is unlikely to belong to him.  \n   • Lyn says she did not even know Fred had a key to her house; this makes it unlikely she felt sufficiently close to Sarah to become her “secret” confidante.  \n   • Harold says he gave up smoking before the Bakers and Cokers ever met the Foys, and none of the others have ever seen him smoke.  \n   • Midge admits she was a smoker “back when Ronald Reagan was president.” Reagan did not take office until 20 January 1981, whereas Sarah died in December 1980—one month earlier while Jimmy Carter was still president.  \n     ⇒ If Midge quit when Reagan was president, she must still have been a smoker in December 1980, so the lighter could well be hers.  \n   • When confronted with the chronology error Midge immediately remembers that Robert Ellingwood, owner of Robert’s Book Store, is her brother, and that the tissue was also hers. She therefore can account for every trace object left behind.\n\n5. Logical deduction  \n   • Only one person fits every piece of physical evidence (lighter, tissue, book-store card) and slips on a key chronological fact that places her as an active smoker during Sarah’s last month of life—Midge.  \n   • No contradictory evidence implicates any of the other three.  \n   • Thus Midge must be the secret visitor and holder of the second key.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBill Baker, Lyn Baker, Harold Coker, Midge Coker\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMidge Coker\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nIn late 1980 twelve-year-old Sarah Foy, gravely ill with leukemia, formed a confidential bond with family friend Midge Coker. Sarah entrusted Midge with the second skeleton key to her bedroom so that Midge could visit and talk with her privately whenever Sarah’s parents were out.\n\nDuring those final weeks Midge, still a smoker at the time, sometimes absent-mindedly carried a cigarette lighter, tissues and her brother’s Robert’s Book Store business cards in her purse. A few of those items inadvertently fell to the bedroom floor on her visits. Midge also wrote encouraging notes in a deliberately awkward hand so the Foys would not recognise her script if they ever saw them.\n\nAfter Sarah’s death Midge, wanting to ease her friends’ burden without attracting attention, anonymously paid the funeral costs, endowed a small scholarship, and placed a memorial stone at Sarah’s church, still using the bedroom key to leave occasional messages of comfort.\n\nYears later, over breakfast, Fred produces his copy of Sarah’s ornate key and, by simple questioning, eliminates Bill (uses matches, not a lighter), Lyn (didn’t even know the inter-family key arrangement) and Harold (quit smoking long before 1980). When Midge states she quit “while Reagan was president,” Fred realises that means she was still smoking in December 1980 when Sarah died, perfectly matching the lighter found in the room. Coupled with the business card link to her brother’s store and the tissue, the chain of evidence identifies her conclusively. Fred thanks her and lets her keep the key in Sarah’s memory.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Bill Baker – Although a smoker, he habitually uses matches, not a lighter; no other evidence ties him to Sarah’s room.  \n• Lyn Baker – Did not even realise the Foys possessed a key to her house, indicating she was unaware of the reciprocal key arrangement. Someone so out of that loop was unlikely to be the clandestine visitor. No items trace to her.  \n• Harold Coker – Quit smoking before ever meeting the Foys; none of the friends have ever seen him smoke. No lighter, no bookstore connection, no tissue trace to him.  \nTherefore only Midge fits every clue; the others are cleared.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "Fred patted Sarah’s secret friend gently on the shoulder. In a shaky voice, he said, “In the back of my mind I suspected it was you, but wasn’t sure until now. Thank you so much from all of us. Do you still have the key?”\nSarah’s friend was very moved and answered, “Yes, do you want it back?” Before Fred could answer, she asked, “How did you figure it out? It’s been a secret all these years.”\nFred said, “No, keep the key. I am certain Sarah would wish for you to have it. As for your other question, well, I didn’t think too much about it until Bumps died, then it began to play in my mind. I’ve wondered how much time I have left to thank a very kind and generous friend. But, I digress. In speaking with all four of you at the same time, it wasn’t too hard to sort this out, although I was frustrated at first. As I asked questions, I eliminated those who claimed not to have the items left in Sarah’s room.” Fred paused a moment for dramatic effect.\nHe continued, “I eliminated Bill because he does not use a lighter. I have no way of knowing if he was ever a customer of Robert’s Book Store or used paper tissue, but he proved to us that he uses matches. In Lyn’s case, she told us she did not know about the spare house key in Bill’s possession.”\nFred paused again, emotion catching up with him. “I wasn’t sure of Harold. But, he told us he quit smoking before we met him and I believe it. I’ve never seen him with a cigar or cigarette.”\nMidge said, “So why me? I’ve answered everything truthfully.”\nFred grinned, “I know, but you made a mistake.”\n“It was your comment concerning smoking. You said you quit sometime while Ronald Reagan was president. President Reagan took office in January of 1981. President Carter was still in office when Sarah passed away in December, 1980.”\nMidge stared at Fred with an incredulous look on her face. Softly, she said, “I forgot about President Carter. Well, you’re probably all wondering about Robert’s Book Store. Robert Ellingwood is my brother. The store went out of business shortly after Sarah died. The tissue was mine, too. … Guess I would not be a very good burglar – or historian.”\nFred smiled and said to her, “Bumps, Sarah and I owe you a debt that can never be repaid. I have learned some very important things about you today.”\nMidge returned his grin and replied, “The first is obvious. What are the others?\n“That you are kind hearted and do our Lord’s good work in secret, but that you also have a very poor memory and a tendency to lose things.”\nLaughter from Fred’s table could be heard throughout the large pancake house."
