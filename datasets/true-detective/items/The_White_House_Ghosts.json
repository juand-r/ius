      "content": "The four ghosts took a look around the East Room before beginning their monthly card game. Invisible to all but themselves, they left no trace on the White House motion detectors. It was complete privacy, of a sort that each might have wished for when president. “I never cease to marvel at how this room has changed,” John Adams said. “Abigail and I used to come here to supervise matters when they were building the White House. Somehow, I never pictured this room quite so grand as it has become.” Andrew Jackson scoffed. “Well, John, that shouldn’t surprise you. I suspect that you wanted a grand setting all the time. I was never sure that you liked the people very much.” “That’s unfair, Andrew. We made the revolution for everyone. And as for a ‘grand setting,’ your inauguration certainly trashed the White House. Why, the only way they got rid of all of the drunks who invited themselves into the reception in this very room was to say that the drinks were being moved to the lawn. Then as the mob left, the White House staff shut the doors after them!” “Hardly my fault, John. Anyway, you talk about preserving the property, but I was the first to order spittoons for the East Room! I got into trouble for that, too, because of the expense. Well, OK, enough of that. Deal the cards, please.” Calvin Coolidge asked, “Is it true, Andrew, that ‘OK’ was what you initialled on state papers when you approved them? The rumor is that you thought that OK stood for ‘All Correct’!” “Too late now to stop that rumor, Calvin. If I didn’t do that, I should have. Besides, you’re the one with the reputation for not saying much.” Calvin Coolidge grinned. “Yes.” He looked at his cards. “One heart.” William Howard Taft shifted his weight as though he could still feel discomfort in his ghostly state. (Even as a ghost, he remained large.) “I still don’t see why the White House uses these little spindly chairs.” “William, did you really once get stuck in the bathtub?” William Howard Taft looked annoyed for a moment, then broke into a large smile. “Well yes, John. The White House ushers had quite a time getting me out! At least I was taking my bath in private. Unlike you, John. One spade.” “Hasn’t everyone heard that story by now? Well, I admit it: Washington was almost uninhabited then, very few visitors on horseback to be bothered with. I used to like to go swimming—skinny dipping I think they call it now—in the Potomac. And once some miscreant stole my clothes from the bank, so I had to send back to the White House for more. Two diamonds.” Andrew Jackson looked at his cards, folded them, and tossed them onto the table. “This isn’t a real game, not like poker. I don’t see why I let you fellows talk me into this. Let’s do something different this month.” “What did you have in mind?” “Well, you know, there is a new family residing in the White House. The election has been held, and the results tallied, and they have just moved in. You remember, eight years ago, the same thing happened. And surely you remember what we did then?” “Yes,” John Adams replied. “We left something for the children. When you put the idea forward then, you mentioned your adopted son, what a comfort he had been. It’s a wonderful tribute to him. I wonder if the last White House children ever figured out who our little mystery.” “Probably not,” said Calvin Coolidge. “But it’s a good idea, General. I remember how wonderful it was to have children in the White House. And animals—like my pet raccoon, Rebecca. The least we can do is make these new children feel welcome.” “What shall we leave?” William Howard Taft asked. “A mystery, like last time, that’ll be fun. Let’s leave a little something that is specific to one of our terms as president, and see if the girls know their history.” “OK,” said Andrew Jackson. “But what?” “Well,” replied William Howard Taft, “it shouldn’t be to hard to figure out. We each did other things besides serving as president. I mean, you, Andrew, were General Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. John was vice president, and an ambassador to France before that. I became Chief Justice of the United States after I left this miserable job, and Calvin was governor of Massachusetts. Together, we should figure out something!” “Yes,” Calvin Coolidge agreed. “And it should be something like the last time; that is, a symbol for peace. Begging your pardon, General, but after all the great wars we have seen, peace remains a great virtue. And it costs less, too! We were each lucky to have avoided great wars while we were in office.” “Not ‘lucky,’” grumbled John Adams. “It takes a lot of effort. Why, there were those who wanted war with France throughout my term. I wouldn’t give in. That’s surely why I was the first one term president!” “I just missed it. War during my presidency, I mean.” William Howard Taft reflected for a moment. “Now, Theodore Roosevelt might have enjoyed himself. He probably thought he was president at the wrong time anyway. But I’m sure that Woodrow Wilson, who came after me, had his hands full with the Great War. But we’re getting carried away here. Let’s get back to our mystery for the new White House children.” The ghosts put their heads together and discussed their game well into the night …\n\t\n**** The next morning, two excited little girls were awakened for breakfast. At their places at the breakfast table were a piece of paper and a small box. Their mother smiled indulgently, for surely her husband had left the note and box as a surprise for the children. The younger girl read the paper. It was in a clear script, bold and easy to read: “To the White House children—may your stay be filled with joy. Can you guess which one of us left this gift for you?” It was signed “Your friends, John Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, Calvin Coolidge.” The girls’ mother smiled at her husband, who returned the smile. The older girl opened the box. Her eyes sparkled with excitement. Inside was a large Christmas tree ornament, in the shape of the White House. On its side was a delicately painted scene, a view of the nation’s capital. A full eight inches across, the ornament would fit nicely on a large branch of a sturdy Christmas tree. “Look, here is where we stayed, before moving into the White House,” she said. “This little painting shows the view from our picture window at the Hay-Adams Hotel.” It was indeed, her mother noticed, except that there was a horse-drawn carriage painted into the scene. She wondered where her husband had found it. “I see a hinge on the side of that beautiful ornament—it might open up. Try it and see.” The little girl’s younger sister said, “My turn!” She lifted the top of the ornament and sure enough, it opened. Inside was painted another tiny scene, this one of the Statue of Liberty, with American flags unfurled. “They look like our flags, almost,” she said, “but the stars are too small to count.” There was, however, clearly visible in the harbor facing the statue, a ship, with soldiers on the deck. One of the soldiers, draped in a tricolor flag, seemed to be wearing a spiked helmet. At that moment, a White House waiter of long service appeared. The president looked at him quizzically. “Something like this happened eight years ago, sir,” the waiter said. “The girls then had a lot of fun trying to figure out which of the presidents who had signed their note might have left the gift, which was also a White House ornament. But it was quite different from this one.” The president whispered to his wife as he got up from the table to go to the Oval Office for the day’s business. “The letter from the last president told me about the ornament left for his children eight years ago. He was quite sure there would be a similar mystery left for our girls on their first morning at the White House!” He added, “I’m sure that you will help the children to figure out which one of my predecessors left this charming gift for them.” The president left the room, and the children, under the gentle prodding of their mother, soon resolved the mystery.",

Invisible to all but themselves, they left no trace on the White House motion detectors. It was complete privacy, of a sort that each might have wished for when president. “I never cease to marvel at how this room has changed,” John Adams said. “Abigail and I used to come here to supervise matters when they were building the White House. Somehow, I never pictured this room quite so grand as it has become.” Andrew Jackson scoffed. “Well, John, that shouldn’t surprise you. I suspect that you wanted a grand setting all the time.

Deal the cards, please.” Calvin Coolidge asked, “Is it true, Andrew, that ‘OK’ was what you initialled on state papers when you approved them? The rumor is that you thought that OK stood for ‘All Correct’!” “Too late now to stop that rumor, Calvin. If I didn’t do that, I should have. Besides, you’re the one with the reputation for not saying much.” Calvin Coolidge grinned. “Yes.” He looked at his cards. “One heart.” William Howard Taft shifted his weight as though he could still feel discomfort in his ghostly state. (Even as a ghost, he remained large.) “I still don’t see why the White House uses these little spindly chairs.” “William, did you really once get stuck in the bathtub?” William Howard Taft looked annoyed for a moment, then broke into a large smile. “Well yes, John. The White House ushers had quite a time getting me out! At least I was taking my bath in private. Unlike you, John. One spade.” “Hasn’t everyone heard that story by now? Well, I admit it: Washington was almost uninhabited then, very few visitors on horseback to be bothered with. I used to like to go swimming—skinny dipping I think they call it now—in the Potomac. And once some miscreant stole my clothes from the bank, so I had to send back to the White House for more. Two diamonds.” Andrew Jackson looked at his cards, folded them, and tossed them onto the table. “This isn’t a real game, not like poker. I don’t see why I let you fellows talk me into this. Let’s do something different this month.” “What did you have in mind?” “Well, you know, there is a new family residing in the White House. The election has been held, and the results tallied, and they have just moved in. You remember, eight years ago, the same thing happened. And surely you remember what we did then?” “Yes,” John Adams replied. “We left something for the children. When you put the idea forward then, you mentioned your adopted son, what a comfort he had been. It’s a wonderful tribute to him. I wonder if the last White House children ever figured out who our little mystery.” “Probably not,” said Calvin Coolidge. “But it’s a good idea, General. I remember how wonderful it was to have children in the White House. And animals—like my pet raccoon, Rebecca. The least we can do is make these new children feel welcome.” “What shall we leave?” William Howard Taft asked. “A mystery, like last time, that’ll be fun. Let’s leave a little something that is specific to one of our terms as president, and see if the girls know their history.” “OK,” said Andrew Jackson. “But what?” “Well,” replied William Howard Taft, “it shouldn’t be to hard to figure out. We each did other things besides serving as president. I mean, you, Andrew, were General Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. John was vice president, and an ambassador to France before that. I became Chief Justice of the United States after I left this miserable job, and Calvin was governor of Massachusetts. Together, we should figure out something!” “Yes,” Calvin Coolidge agreed. “And it should be something like the last time; that is, a symbol for peace. Begging your pardon, General, but after all the great wars we have seen, peace remains a great virtue. And it costs less, too! We were each lucky to have avoided great wars while we were in office.” “Not ‘lucky,’” grumbled John Adams. “It takes a lot of effort. Why, there were those who wanted war with France throughout my term. I wouldn’t give in. That’s surely why I was the first one term president!” “I just missed it. War during my presidency, I mean.” William Howard Taft reflected for a moment. “Now, Theodore Roosevelt might have enjoyed himself. He probably thought he was president at the wrong time anyway. But I’m sure that Woodrow Wilson, who came after me, had his hands full with the Great War. But we’re getting carried away here. Let’s get back to our mystery for the new White House children.” The ghosts put their heads together and discussed their game well into the night …\n\t\n**** The next morning, two excited little girls were awakened for breakfast. At their places at the breakfast table were a piece of paper and a small box. Their mother smiled indulgently, for surely her husband had left the note and box as a surprise for the children. The younger girl read the paper. It was in a clear script, bold and easy to read: “To the White House children—may your stay be filled with joy. Can you guess which one of us left this gift for you?” It was signed “Your friends, John Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, Calvin Coolidge.” The girls’ mother smiled at her husband, who returned the smile. The older girl opened the box. Her eyes sparkled with excitement. Inside was a large Christmas tree ornament, in the shape of the White House. On its side was a delicately painted scene, a view of the nation’s capital. A full eight inches across, the ornament would fit nicely on a large branch of a sturdy Christmas tree. “Look, here is where we stayed, before moving into the White House,” she said. “This little painting shows the view from our picture window at the Hay-Adams Hotel.” It was indeed, her mother noticed, except that there was a horse-drawn carriage painted into the scene. She wondered where her husband had found it. “I see a hinge on the side of that beautiful ornament—it might open up. Try it and see.” The little girl’s younger sister said, “My turn!” She lifted the top of the ornament and sure enough, it opened. Inside was painted another tiny scene, this one of the Statue of Liberty, with American flags unfurled. “They look like our flags, almost,” she said, “but the stars are too small to count.” There was, however, clearly visible in the harbor facing the statue, a ship, with soldiers on the deck. One of the soldiers, draped in a tricolor flag, seemed to be wearing a spiked helmet. At that moment, a White House waiter of long service appeared. The president looked at him quizzically. “Something like this happened eight years ago, sir,” the waiter said. “The girls then had a lot of fun trying to figure out which of the presidents who had signed their note might have left the gift, which was also a White House ornament. But it was quite different from this one.” The president whispered to his wife as he got up from the table to go to the Oval Office for the day’s business. “The letter from the last president told me about the ornament left for his children eight years ago. He was quite sure there would be a similar mystery left for our girls on their first morning at the White House!” He added, “I’m sure that you will help the children to figure out which one of my predecessors left this charming gift for them.” The president left the room, and the children, under the gentle prodding of their mother, soon resolved the mystery.\nThere is a horse-drawn carriage painted on the ornament. There were so few people in Washington, let alone horseback or horse-drawn traffic, when John Adams was president, that he could go swimming in the Potomac River!\nA horse-drawn carriage could be seen in Washington during the other three presidencies, if only as an attraction for tourists. However, Andrew Jackson is further excluded by the Statue of Liberty, which was erected in 1886, a half-century after his presidency.\nThe ship with returning soldiers in New York Harbor could refer to either William Howard Taft (for the reference could be to the Spanish-American War, which ended a few years before his presidency), or to Calvin Coolidge, who would have remembered soldiers returning home from the Great War, now called the First World War, in 1919. The fact that a soldier is waving a souvenir French flag and is wearing a liberated German spiked helmet confirms the reference to Coolidge. That war was fought against Germany in France.\nWe do not know precisely what President Bush wrote to President Obama.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the “crime”  \n   •  A White-House Christmas-tree ornament of unknown origin has been left for the two first-daughters.  \n   •  The note is signed by four presidential ghosts: John Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, Calvin Coolidge.  \n   •  One—and only one—of them is the actual giver.  \n\n2. Motive  \n   •  All four like the idea of welcoming children and honouring peace, but each wants the riddle to be solvable from details that point to himself.  \n   •  Therefore the true donor will have hidden clues that connect uniquely with events or imagery from his own lifetime.\n\n3. Opportunity & means  \n   •  Being ghosts inside the White House, each had equal opportunity; no alibis eliminate anyone.  \n   •  Physical evidence must therefore do the work of identification.\n\n4. Examine the physical clues painted on (or implicit in) the ornament  \n   a)  Exterior scene – the Hay-Adams view of the White House with a horse-drawn carriage.  \n   b)  Interior scene – Statue of Liberty; U.S. soldiers returning by ship; one soldier draped in a French tricolour and wearing a captured German spiked helmet (Pickelhaube).  \n\n5. Eliminate suspects one by one  \n\n   •  John Adams (President 1797-1801)  \n     ‑ At that time Washington, D.C. was mostly a muddy construction site; there was scarcely any “traffic,” organised tourist carriage rides, or even a fully built White House to view from Lafayette Square.  \n     ‑ The Statue of Liberty did not exist until 1886, long after Adams’s life.  \n     →  Clues do not fit; Adams out.  \n\n   •  Andrew Jackson (1829-1837)  \n     ‑ Horse-drawn traffic fits his era, but again the Statue of Liberty was fifty years in the future.  \n     →  Jackson out.  \n\n   •  William Howard Taft (1909-1913)  \n     ‑ Statue of Liberty already standing: plausible.  \n     ‑ A ship of soldiers “returning home” could be the Yankee Expeditionary Force from the Spanish-American War (1898) or the Philippine conflict that followed, both of which Taft was connected with as Governor-General and Secretary of War.  \n     ‑ HOWEVER the soldiers in the picture carry a French flag and one sports a German Pickelhaube. That imagery is foreign to the Spanish-American War but exactly matches the Western Front of World War I.  \n     →  Taft unlikely.  \n\n   •  Calvin Coolidge (1923-1929)  \n     ‑ Statue of Liberty already a national icon and beacon to returning Doughboys in 1919.  \n     ‑ Soldiers coming home from the “Great War” would indeed be waving French flags and showing off captured German helmets—an instantly recognisable 1918-1919 motif.  \n     ‑ Coolidge spoke often of peace after the Great War (e.g., the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact). A peace-themed ornament featuring soldiers returning safely is consistent with his outlook.  \n     →  All clues align uniquely with Coolidge.\n\n6. Logical conclusion  \n   With Adams and Jackson chronologically impossible, and the French/German war trophies eliminating Taft, the only remaining ghost who both could and would embed those specific images is Calvin Coolidge.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohn Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, Calvin Coolidge\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCalvin Coolidge\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nDuring their monthly ghostly card game in the East Room the four presidents decided—just as they had eight years earlier—to leave a welcoming puzzle for the new first-family’s children. Each man suggested possible symbols from his own life. When the conversation turned to “a symbol for peace,” Calvin Coolidge quietly took charge.\n\nLate that night, unseen by mortals, Coolidge fashioned an eight-inch White-House ornament. On the outside he painted the Obama family’s temporary lodging, the Hay-Adams Hotel, as a personal wink to the girls, and added a decorative horse-drawn carriage to invoke the charm of an earlier Washington without contradicting modern reality.\n\nInside he painted the Statue of Liberty—the beacon that, in 1919, greeted troops returning from the First World War. To make the allusion unmistakable, he showed the soldiers waving a French tricolour souvenir and displaying a captured German Pickelhaube helmet, precisely the sort of trophies Doughboys shipped home. The tableau celebrated the war’s end and the return of peace, a cause Coolidge championed throughout his presidency.\n\nBefore dawn he slipped the ornament and the jointly signed note onto the family breakfast table. The next morning the first-daughters, prompted by their mother, followed the clues and—just as Coolidge intended—identified him as their mysterious benefactor.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  John Adams – Washington City was a semi-wilderness during his term; no completed White House vista, no Hay-Adams location, and certainly no Statue of Liberty. The ornament’s imagery post-dates his lifetime by almost a century.\n\n•  Andrew Jackson – Although horse-drawn carriages suit Jackson’s era, the Statue of Liberty did not yet exist, so he could not reference it. Additionally, nothing in the ornament reflects Jackson’s military fame at New Orleans or his populist themes.\n\n•  William Howard Taft – The Statue of Liberty was present in his lifetime, but the soldier with a French flag and captured German helmet belongs to World War I, six years after his presidency. Taft’s military association was with the Spanish-American War and the Philippines, where the adversaries wore no Pickelhauben and the French tricolour was irrelevant.\n\nThus only Calvin Coolidge matches every element of the evidence, making him—and no one else—the benevolent “culprit.”\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
