      "content": "Peter came bursting in the door, his tricorn hat falling off as he shouted: “Someone has stolen the new cannon, right out from under the guards’ noses.” John Webster, Peter's father, emerged from his office into the entryway still holding the feather quill and bill of lading he had been checking. He was wearing the new bifocal glasses that Benjamin Franklin had recently invented. He reached up and smoothed his brown hair, which like most men and boys of the time was bound behind the neck and reached his shoulders. “Who do they think took it?” he asked. Peter, who was a miniature of his father except for having red hair, tried to keep the details straight as he answered: “Well, Constable Barnes says that there are four suspects already and that he is pretty sure that at least one of them is guilty.” Peter's father walked over to the window that looked over the loading dock and wondered aloud: “How could they have removed that enormous weight without someone noticing or hearing something?” The Boston streets were packed with people talking about the brazen theft. Peter's mother Anna and little sister Emma were walking over the cobblestones toward him, their blond hair peeking out from beneath their frilly white caps. “Where's your father?” his mother asked. Peter turned and pointed to a group of men talking quietly by the ship emblazoned with the name “Resolve” painted on its prow. “He's talking to the constable about the men who have been arrested,” Peter explained. “Are they anyone that we know?” Emma asked. “Yes, all of them are local people except for Captain Parker, and he's been in and out of the harbor many times; and father's company has dealt with him for many years,\" Peter responded. “Bob Turkle, the blacksmith, Tom Wise, the fishmonger, and Paul Rhodes, the baker, are the other suspects, but so far nobody has told how it happened,” Peter said. The crime was simple enough. The new experimental long-range cannon, developed and cast in France, was shipped topside because of ease of loading and removal. Sometime last night, when it was high tide, some person or persons had taken it. A cannon of this length and weight should require several dockworkers using block and tackle to remove it. Block and tackle, being notorious for making noise, and the light needed for the delicate operation, would make secrecy seemingly impossible. Also, two trusted guards had paced the docks all night and had seen nothing unusual. There were derricks hanging out over the water at intervals, but none of them were rigged. How did they do it? Peter walked over and listened to his father and the constable as they quietly discussed what the suspects had told them. Captain Parker had been aboard all night and had heard nothing. Dressed all in black, including hair and beard, he seemed to be a giant. “Look, constable, you came down here yourself and looked at the cannon and so did Mr. Webster, who signed my docking papers,” he said. “I was paid to deliver the cannon to the dock and that is what I did. Now let me go about my business,” he said firmly. “Well, you were three weeks late and now you're in a hurry,” said the constable, looking the captain in the eye. “Give us one more hour and then you can begin unloading.” Bob Turkle, a burly man with large, muscular arms, who was a fervent patriot, was next to be questioned. The guards had talked to him about an hour before daylight on the dock. This was before the theft of the cannon was discovered. He always arose before dawn to start the fire in his forge. After performing this task, he walked down to the docks to check on a load of pig iron that Captain Parker had agreed to bring with the cannon. Pig iron is a common metal, often in brick shapes, used by blacksmiths to make metal items. “Captain Parker often brings my iron for me and this time he gave me a break in price because he was docking here to deliver the cannon,” Bob said. Tom Wise and Paul Rhodes, the fishmonger and baker, were suspects because they were king's men and had been heard threatening to sink the Resolve. “Aye, I’m a loyalist,” the small-framed Wise admitted proudly, “but I’m no thief.” The baker was no less outspoken. “Everyone knows I’m for King George,” Rhodes said, raising his voice and standing up despite his limp. “The patriots are making a mess of things and are going to bring us to ruination. But I don’t have yer gun. And if I did, where would I put it, my bakery?” he said, sneering. Peter, John and the constable then inspected the ship but found it empty except for the enormous stack of iron running along the keel. It was covered with an oil-impregnated cloth to keep the salt air from rusting it. They raised the cloth to get a better look and stared at the iron bricks. When they returned to the dock the hour was almost up. Peter went over to his father who was staring at the bow of the ship, trying to figure out the enigma. “Father, what are those roman numerals going down the side of the bow?” Peter asked. \n“What? Oh, those tell how deep in the water the ship is laden,” he said. He did a double take. John Webster suddenly turned and looked at Peter with a great smile on his face. “Peter, I think you have solved the mystery,” he said. “Give me two minutes in my office and I'll tell you for sure.” When John Webster returned he said to his son: “The ship was as deep in the water as it was yesterday.” Webster announced to the crowd: “I know where the cannon is and who took it.”",

          "reveal_text": "John Webster explained to everyone that Bob Turkle, the blacksmith, had no motive, as he’s a patriot. Why would he want to steal the gun and hurt his cause?”\n“Tom Wise, the fishmonger,” Webster continued, “is simply not big and strong enough to handle such a large ordnance. And Paul Rhodes, the baker, has a limp. He also couldn’t have shifted it.”\nHe pointed to the captain. “Arrest him. He moved the cannon.”\nThe captain appeared grim and the constable looked confused. “He couldn't move that heavy thing alone,” the constable insisted. “It would take at least five men with block and tackle.”\nJohn smiled. “Peter gave me the idea. This is how the captain did it: The ancient Greeks used ocean tides to lower and lift enormous weights from their ships,” John explained. “Captain Parker used the same principle to move the cannon.”\nThe constable laughed. “Then where did he carry it John, and how come nobody saw him?”\nJohn pointed past the docks. “It's still on the ship, constable.”\nJohn explained how he had checked the draft numerals yesterday when the ship first docked and when Peter had asked him about the numerals he noticed that they were the same today. The cannon had to still be on the ship.\nCaptain Parker had stalled at sea until he knew that a very high tide was going to occur. That was the night of the theft. By attaching a single pulley – well oiled to prevent noise – to the overhanging lifting arm, running a chain through it with one end attached to the cannon and the other to a cleat beneath the stack of iron, he had a hydraulic lifting device.\nBy waiting until the ship was almost at its lowest point and then attaching the chain, the cannon was only raised enough to swing it over the hatch. Since the distance from the cannon’s resting place on deck to the top of the iron pile was only a few feet, it was lowered easily when the tide started raising the ship.\nWhile the captain was waiting for this to occur, he removed the oilcloth and also enough iron brick to create a hole for the cannon to be secreted in. When the transfer was complete he simply piled the brick back over the cannon and replaced the oilcloth. A cursory inspection around the perimeter of the iron pile would reveal nothing.\n“Well done, Peter,\" his father said. \"Ten more minutes and the captain would have removed the blacksmith’s iron from the outside of the pile, changing the weight and hiding the difference from us.”\nJohn Webster stared at the captain a moment before speaking. “Captain Parker, I don't know why you did it, but I suspect it was to sell to the British for a profit.”\nPeter felt great. Even though he knew that his father had solved the mystery, he had helped a little.",

Clear financial motive.  \n   • Turkle: Patriot; stealing the gun would hurt his own cause. No obvious motive.  \n   • Wise & Rhodes: Loyalists who openly dislike Patriots. Possible motive to deprive the rebels of a new weapon, but they would need somewhere to hide, store or move a multi-ton cannon—unlikely for a fishmonger or baker.  \n\n3. Examine Opportunity and Physical Possibility.  \n   • The cannon weighs many tons; moving it silently from a ship’s deck requires tackle or ingenious use of tides.  \n   • Guards saw and heard nothing and no derricks were rigged. Therefore any removal either created no noise/light or never left the ship at all.  \n   • Turkle, Wise, Rhodes were never on board during the critical high-tide window; only Parker had constant access to the deck and the iron ballast in the hold.  \n\n4. Analyze the key physical clue—the draft numerals.  \n   • Yesterday the Resolve sat at Roman numeral mark X (example).  \n   • This morning, after the “theft,” she sits at exactly the same mark.  \n   • If the cannon (several tons) had been removed, the ship would ride higher in the water; her draft should be noticeably shallower.  \n   • Therefore the weight never left the ship; it was merely relocated inside it.  \n\n5. Combine 2, 3, and 4.  \n   • Only Parker could both hide the cannon aboard and later sail away with it.  \n   • His delay at sea allowed him to use an unusually high tide.  \n   • He used a single well-oiled block on a lifting arm, chained the gun to the iron ballast, waited for the tide to rise, swung the gun over the hatch and lowered it into a cavity he had dug in the ballast pile, then re-stacked the bricks and replaced the oilcloth.  \n\nConclusion: Parker alone had motive, opportunity, physical ability, and the ship-handling knowledge to conceal the gun while leaving draft marks unchanged.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCaptain Nathaniel Parker, Bob Turkle, Tom Wise, Paul Rhodes\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCaptain Nathaniel Parker\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Earlier in the week Parker learned the night of docking would coincide with an exceptionally high tide.  \n• After mooring, he waited until the tide reached its lowest ebb in the early hours.  \n• He secretly rigged a single, well-greased pulley to the ship’s overhanging cargo boom, ran a chain through it, and shackled one end to the cannon, the other to a strong cleat deep in the iron-ballast pile along the keel.  \n• When the tide began to rise, the ship lifted while the cannon—chained to the ballast—remained effectively “fixed” relative to the wharf. The relative motion made the cannon clear the deck by a foot or two.  \n• Parker then swung the cannon sideways over the open hatch, removed enough pig-iron bricks to form a cavity, and when the tide finished rising he slackened the chain and lowered the weapon into the hole.  \n• He re-stacked the iron bricks, replaced the oil-cloth, and removed the temporary tackle. On the surface nothing looked disturbed, and the ship’s total weight (cannon + iron) never changed so her draft marks stayed identical.  \n• At daybreak he claimed ignorance and demanded to start unloading, intending to remove part of the iron first—lightening the ship so later observers would think the missing weight was due to pig iron, not a cannon.  \n• John Webster checked yesterday’s and today’s draft marks, realized the weight had not left the vessel, and exposed the ruse before Parker could adjust the ballast.  \n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Bob Turkle: A staunch Patriot whose livelihood depends on that very cargo of pig iron; stealing the cannon would sabotage his own cause. Guards spoke with him on the dock before dawn, proving he was never alone on the deck. He also lacked equipment to hide a cannon.  \n• Tom Wise: Small stature and no access to the vessel at night; physically incapable of manipulating several tons of bronze or iron without attracting attention. No storage location to hide it.  \n• Paul Rhodes: Walks with a limp, even less able to shift such a weight and likewise never had shipboard access. A baker’s shop could not conceal an artillery piece without instant discovery.  \nOnly Captain Parker had uninterrupted access, nautical knowledge, financial incentive, and the means to use the tide to “steal” the cannon while it never actually left his ship.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "John Webster explained to everyone that Bob Turkle, the blacksmith, had no motive, as he’s a patriot. Why would he want to steal the gun and hurt his cause?”\n“Tom Wise, the fishmonger,” Webster continued, “is simply not big and strong enough to handle such a large ordnance. And Paul Rhodes, the baker, has a limp. He also couldn’t have shifted it.”\nHe pointed to the captain. “Arrest him. He moved the cannon.”\nThe captain appeared grim and the constable looked confused. “He couldn't move that heavy thing alone,” the constable insisted. “It would take at least five men with block and tackle.”\nJohn smiled. “Peter gave me the idea. This is how the captain did it: The ancient Greeks used ocean tides to lower and lift enormous weights from their ships,” John explained. “Captain Parker used the same principle to move the cannon.”\nThe constable laughed. “Then where did he carry it John, and how come nobody saw him?”\nJohn pointed past the docks. “It's still on the ship, constable.”\nJohn explained how he had checked the draft numerals yesterday when the ship first docked and when Peter had asked him about the numerals he noticed that they were the same today. The cannon had to still be on the ship.\nCaptain Parker had stalled at sea until he knew that a very high tide was going to occur. That was the night of the theft. By attaching a single pulley – well oiled to prevent noise – to the overhanging lifting arm, running a chain through it with one end attached to the cannon and the other to a cleat beneath the stack of iron, he had a hydraulic lifting device.\nBy waiting until the ship was almost at its lowest point and then attaching the chain, the cannon was only raised enough to swing it over the hatch. Since the distance from the cannon’s resting place on deck to the top of the iron pile was only a few feet, it was lowered easily when the tide started raising the ship.\nWhile the captain was waiting for this to occur, he removed the oilcloth and also enough iron brick to create a hole for the cannon to be secreted in. When the transfer was complete he simply piled the brick back over the cannon and replaced the oilcloth. A cursory inspection around the perimeter of the iron pile would reveal nothing.\n“Well done, Peter,\" his father said. \"Ten more minutes and the captain would have removed the blacksmith’s iron from the outside of the pile, changing the weight and hiding the difference from us.”\nJohn Webster stared at the captain a moment before speaking. “Captain Parker, I don't know why you did it, but I suspect it was to sell to the British for a profit.”\nPeter felt great. Even though he knew that his father had solved the mystery, he had helped a little."
