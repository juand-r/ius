      "content": "Mick was the smartest guy in my neighborhood. Sure he was homeless, but Mick took that as proof of how smart he was. Hebragged that he never had to pay rent, and he never worried about paying car insurance. Every morning he'd sit at the bus stop and laugh at all the people who had to go to work. There was only one thing Mick was afraid of -- the police. There were laws against vagrancy, because, as Mick pointed out, \"People always assume homeless people will eventually rob them.\" We were standing at the bus stop, and the sun was just coming up. I'd missed the 8:30 bus, and I'd have to wait for the 8:50. But in the next 20 minutes, I'd also be solving a mystery. Mick was sitting on the bench at the bus stop, and it looked like he was actually humming. I thought he'd be cold and grumpy, but he'd bundled himself up in a spiffy spring outfit -- a brown scarf, a brown ski cap and thick brown mittens. I reminded myself that I'd have a warm apartment and a roof over my head tonight -- but it still seemed like Mick was happier than me. \"How long you going to be at work today?\" Mick asked enthusiastically. \"Eight hours,\" I said. \"Do you have to ask permission to leave your desk?\" he asked playfully. I looked down, trying to think up a good comeback, and Mick laughed delightedly. \"Hope it's worth it,\" he said. And that's when we saw Mr. Storimon. A cab was pulling up to the curb, but its door swung open before the cab had even reached the bus stop. Mr. Storimon exploded out of the door, trying to yank his wallet out of his pants pocket with one hand while pulling his expensive overcoat onto his shoulder with the other hand. He'd worked for 40 years at a bank downtown, but nobody really liked him. It was obvious he wanted respect after all that hard work -- but he treated people rudely, which made everyone be rude back to him. His white hair and pale skin almost matched the overcoat's color, and he looked like an angry snowman. \"How much?\" he barked at the cab driver, and when the cab driver said \"$19.90,\" Mr. Storimon gave him a twenty-dollar bill. (\"Not much of a tipper,\" Mick whispered to me with a laugh.) Storimon tried to slide the wallet back into his pocket, but apparently he missed. As he rushed to the bus stop, we heard it flop into a puddle on the street behind him . \"Let's see how long it takes before he notices,\" I said mischievously to Mick. It was even funnier when Mr. Storimon glared at Mick. \"No, I'm not giving you a handout.\" \"I'm not asking you for one,\" said Mick. \"You need to earn money.\" \"I've got money,\" said Mick. \"Well, then you need to learn how to hang onto it.\" \"So do you,\" I said. Mick and I laughed. Mr. Storimon glared, and I felt a little sorry for him as he muttered something obscene and then started reading the Wall Street Journal. \"People are funny,\" I whispered to Mick. Now I could see now why he enjoyed hanging out at the bus stop. I closed my eyes for a quick nap, but when I opened them someone else was at the bus stop. Wearing a loose Metallica shirt, a punk rocker had rolled up silently on his skateboard. I wondered what Mr. Storimon would do when he noticed... Danny's hair was cropped short, and he looked like he could be part of the band but he'd obviously been skateboarding for a while, because his face was covered with sweat. Maybe that's why he wanted to take the bus. When he got to its stop, Danny stepped off the skateboard and gave it a trick kick. It suddenly rose up off of the sidewalk, and Danny grabbed it without even bending over. He didn't say a word, but it was obvious he was trying to impress us. Mr. Storimon just rustled his newspaper. Danny didn't move -- he just stood there trying to look cool. In his own way, he seemed even lonelier than Mr. Storimon, and I felt sorry for him, too. Mick offered him a piece of gum. As Danny opened the gum and put it in his mouth, I noticed that his left hand was in a cast that went all the way to his elbow. For some reason, this made Mick laugh. \"He can't be that good of a skater,\" Mick whispered to me, \"if he's broken his left arm.\" Danny glared, then asked Mick \"Do you ever have any trouble with the cops?\" Mick nodded, and Danny said he understood. \"I'm always getting in trouble for skating where I shouldn't be. But skateboarding shouldn't be illegal. It's a form of exercise, just like riding your bike!\" \"You should both get a job,\" muttered Mr. Storimon. \"I started my first company with just a $100 dollar bill.\" But Mick didn't say anything. He had a scared look on his face, and he started looking around like he was trying to find someplace to hide. Looking up the street, I realized what had scared him. It was a police officer. He was eating an enormous doughnut, and he looked pretty happy, even if he wasn't smiling. There was a smudge of chocolate on his cheek, which almost matched the black uniform he was wearing. He looked over at the bus stop, like he was hoping none of the four of us were going to interrupt his breakfast. Mick looked down at the sidewalk and tried not to make eye contact. The police officer had just gobbled his first chocolate-filled bite of the shiny glazed doughnut, chewed for a moment, and then mumbled, \"Everything all right here?\" Danny didn't say anything, and I looked over at Mr. Storimon, who seemed thoroughly disinterested. \"Yes, everything's all right,\" he grumbled, reaching his hand into his pocket. And then suddenly, he realized his wallet was missing. \"No!\" Mr. Storimon shouted. \"Somebody's stolen my wallet!\" Mr. Storimon patted every one of his pockets, while his flustered white head looked in every direction. I smiled to myself, and was about to point out that he'd dropped his wallet --but the police officer insisted that everyone be quiet and asked if Mr. Storimon was sure that he'd had his wallet with him. \"Yes! I had it when I got out of the taxi!\" Mr. Storimon blustered. \"It's true,\" I said. \"I saw him pay the cab driver. But -- \" \"Maybe he stole it!\" Mr. Storimon shouted accusingly at Mick. \"I didn't!\" Mick insisted. But the police officer looked over curiously to where Mick and Danny were standing. \"Don't look at me, dude,\" Danny said quickly. \"Hold it!\" I said. \"The wallet's in the street! It fell out of his pocket when he got out of the cab, and nobody stole anything.\" Everyone was quiet for a second, until the police officer strolled over to the puddle by the curb and found the \"missing\" wallet. \"Is this yours?\" he said to Mr. Storimon, holding up the wallet. Mick started laughing, which made Mr. Storimon's white face turn red. \"We all saw you drop it. And then you told me I should hold on to my money. Whenever anything's missing, they always want to blame the homeless guy.\" \"Or the skater punk,\" added Danny. \"No one's blaming anybody,\" Mr. Storimon said. Soon everyone at the bus stop was engaged in a furious debate about the city's law enforcement policies. It took a couple of minutes before the police officer could get Mr. Storimon to stop arguing long enough to take the wallet out of the police officer's hand. \"If city ordinance number 213 had passed on the April ballot...\" Danny was screaming. \"Hold it!\" shouted Mr. Storimon. \"My money's missing!\" \"What?\" said the four of us -- all speaking at exactly the same time. Then everyone stopped talking, and the bus stop was silent. \"My wallet was full of hundred dollar bills,\" Mr. Storimond said. \"Sometimes I'll flash one around when I'm telling the story of the company I founded.\" Then he held out a handful of green bills, and fanned them so we could see. \"All of my hundred dollar bills are gone.\" Sure enough, there were no hundreds or even fifties -- nothing but clean, crisp $20 dollar bills -- but not a $100 bill anywhere. \"This is your idea of a joke,\" he said angrily to the homeless man, \"because I told you I'd started my company with a hundred dollar bill.\" \"No way, dude,\" said Danny. \"How do we know the old guy's telling the truth?\" I told him I didn't think Mick would steal his money, but Mr. Storimon said angrily \"You were napping. You don't know what anyone was doing. You didn't wake up until after the kid on the skateboard got here. Even he could've stolen the money by the time you got your eyes open.\" \"I think the police officer did it,\" Mick said. \"While we were arguing, he lifted the hundreds for himself. Then he'd finally have an excuse to arrest the homeless guy.\" The old man stared, the skateboarder glared, and the police officer took a second bite of his chocolate-filled doughnut. Fortunately, I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.",

Hebragged that he never had to pay rent, and he never worried about paying car insurance. Every morning he'd sit at the bus stop and laugh at all the people who had to go to work. There was only one thing Mick was afraid of -- the police. There were laws against vagrancy, because, as Mick pointed out, \"People always assume homeless people will eventually rob them.\" We were standing at the bus stop, and the sun was just coming up. I'd missed the 8:30 bus, and I'd have to wait for the 8:50. But in the next 20 minutes, I'd also be solving a mystery. Mick was sitting on the bench at the bus stop, and it looked like he was actually humming. I thought he'd be cold and grumpy, but he'd bundled himself up in a spiffy spring outfit -- a brown scarf, a brown ski cap and thick brown mittens. I reminded myself that I'd have a warm apartment and a roof over my head tonight -- but it still seemed like Mick was happier than me. \"How long you going to be at work today?\" Mick asked enthusiastically. \"Eight hours,\" I said. \"Do you have to ask permission to leave your desk?\" he asked playfully. I looked down, trying to think up a good comeback, and Mick laughed delightedly. \"Hope it's worth it,\" he said. And that's when we saw Mr. Storimon. A cab was pulling up to the curb, but its door swung open before the cab had even reached the bus stop. Mr. Storimon exploded out of the door, trying to yank his wallet out of his pants pocket with one hand while pulling his expensive overcoat onto his shoulder with the other hand. He'd worked for 40 years at a bank downtown, but nobody really liked him. It was obvious he wanted respect after all that hard work -- but he treated people rudely, which made everyone be rude back to him. His white hair and pale skin almost matched the overcoat's color, and he looked like an angry snowman. \"How much?\" he barked at the cab driver, and when the cab driver said \"$19.90,\" Mr. Storimon gave him a twenty-dollar bill. (\"Not much of a tipper,\" Mick whispered to me with a laugh.) Storimon tried to slide the wallet back into his pocket, but apparently he missed. As he rushed to the bus stop, we heard it flop into a puddle on the street behind him . \"Let's see how long it takes before he notices,\" I said mischievously to Mick. It was even funnier when Mr. Storimon glared at Mick. \"No, I'm not giving you a handout.\" \"I'm not asking you for one,\" said Mick. \"You need to earn money.\" \"I've got money,\" said Mick. \"Well, then you need to learn how to hang onto it.\" \"So do you,\" I said. Mick and I laughed. Mr. Storimon glared, and I felt a little sorry for him as he muttered something obscene and then started reading the Wall Street Journal. \"People are funny,\" I whispered to Mick. Now I could see now why he enjoyed hanging out at the bus stop. I closed my eyes for a quick nap, but when I opened them someone else was at the bus stop. Wearing a loose Metallica shirt, a punk rocker had rolled up silently on his skateboard. I wondered what Mr. Storimon would do when he noticed... Danny's hair was cropped short, and he looked like he could be part of the band but he'd obviously been skateboarding for a while, because his face was covered with sweat. Maybe that's why he wanted to take the bus. When he got to its stop, Danny stepped off the skateboard and gave it a trick kick. It suddenly rose up off of the sidewalk, and Danny grabbed it without even bending over. He didn't say a word, but it was obvious he was trying to impress us. Mr. Storimon just rustled his newspaper. Danny didn't move -- he just stood there trying to look cool. In his own way, he seemed even lonelier than Mr. Storimon, and I felt sorry for him, too. Mick offered him a piece of gum. As Danny opened the gum and put it in his mouth, I noticed that his left hand was in a cast that went all the way to his elbow. For some reason, this made Mick laugh. \"He can't be that good of a skater,\" Mick whispered to me, \"if he's broken his left arm.\" Danny glared, then asked Mick \"Do you ever have any trouble with the cops?\" Mick nodded, and Danny said he understood. \"I'm always getting in trouble for skating where I shouldn't be. But skateboarding shouldn't be illegal. It's a form of exercise, just like riding your bike!\" \"You should both get a job,\" muttered Mr. Storimon. \"I started my first company with just a $100 dollar bill.\" But Mick didn't say anything. He had a scared look on his face, and he started looking around like he was trying to find someplace to hide. Looking up the street, I realized what had scared him. It was a police officer. He was eating an enormous doughnut, and he looked pretty happy, even if he wasn't smiling. There was a smudge of chocolate on his cheek, which almost matched the black uniform he was wearing. He looked over at the bus stop, like he was hoping none of the four of us were going to interrupt his breakfast. Mick looked down at the sidewalk and tried not to make eye contact. The police officer had just gobbled his first chocolate-filled bite of the shiny glazed doughnut, chewed for a moment, and then mumbled, \"Everything all right here?\" Danny didn't say anything, and I looked over at Mr. Storimon, who seemed thoroughly disinterested. \"Yes, everything's all right,\" he grumbled, reaching his hand into his pocket. And then suddenly, he realized his wallet was missing. \"No!\" Mr. Storimon shouted. \"Somebody's stolen my wallet!\" Mr. Storimon patted every one of his pockets, while his flustered white head looked in every direction. I smiled to myself, and was about to point out that he'd dropped his wallet --but the police officer insisted that everyone be quiet and asked if Mr. Storimon was sure that he'd had his wallet with him. \"Yes! I had it when I got out of the taxi!\" Mr. Storimon blustered. \"It's true,\" I said. \"I saw him pay the cab driver. But -- \" \"Maybe he stole it!\" Mr. Storimon shouted accusingly at Mick. \"I didn't!\" Mick insisted. But the police officer looked over curiously to where Mick and Danny were standing. \"Don't look at me, dude,\" Danny said quickly. \"Hold it!\" I said. \"The wallet's in the street! It fell out of his pocket when he got out of the cab, and nobody stole anything.\" Everyone was quiet for a second, until the police officer strolled over to the puddle by the curb and found the \"missing\" wallet. \"Is this yours?\" he said to Mr. Storimon, holding up the wallet. Mick started laughing, which made Mr. Storimon's white face turn red. \"We all saw you drop it. And then you told me I should hold on to my money. Whenever anything's missing, they always want to blame the homeless guy.\" \"Or the skater punk,\" added Danny. \"No one's blaming anybody,\" Mr. Storimon said. Soon everyone at the bus stop was engaged in a furious debate about the city's law enforcement policies. It took a couple of minutes before the police officer could get Mr. Storimon to stop arguing long enough to take the wallet out of the police officer's hand. \"If city ordinance number 213 had passed on the April ballot...\" Danny was screaming. \"Hold it!\" shouted Mr. Storimon. \"My money's missing!\" \"What?\" said the four of us -- all speaking at exactly the same time. Then everyone stopped talking, and the bus stop was silent. \"My wallet was full of hundred dollar bills,\" Mr. Storimond said. \"Sometimes I'll flash one around when I'm telling the story of the company I founded.\" Then he held out a handful of green bills, and fanned them so we could see. \"All of my hundred dollar bills are gone.\" Sure enough, there were no hundreds or even fifties -- nothing but clean, crisp $20 dollar bills -- but not a $100 bill anywhere. \"This is your idea of a joke,\" he said angrily to the homeless man, \"because I told you I'd started my company with a hundred dollar bill.\" \"No way, dude,\" said Danny. \"How do we know the old guy's telling the truth?\" I told him I didn't think Mick would steal his money, but Mr. Storimon said angrily \"You were napping. You don't know what anyone was doing. You didn't wake up until after the kid on the skateboard got here. Even he could've stolen the money by the time you got your eyes open.\" \"I think the police officer did it,\" Mick said. \"While we were arguing, he lifted the hundreds for himself. Then he'd finally have an excuse to arrest the homeless guy.\" The old man stared, the skateboarder glared, and the police officer took a second bite of his chocolate-filled doughnut. Fortunately, I'd already figured out who'd stolen the money.\n\"Stop accusing the police officer,\" I said. \"He has that big glazed doughnut in his hand, and he's only on his second bite. Even if he held the wallet in his other hand, you can't rifle through its bills if you're still holding a big, glazed doughnut.\"\nMick looked over at Danny, and then realized another clue. \"And you also couldn't rifle through the bills if your whole left hand was in a cast,\" he pointed out. Danny looked down at his cast -- but then he looked back over at Mick's hands.\n\"And you're wearing thick brown mittens,\" Danny said. \"They look pretty warm, but it seems like wearing something that bulky would make it impossible to flick through the bills.\"\n\"I know the final clue,\" said the police officer. \"I lifted that wallet out of a puddle. And after lying there for so long, the bills should've been wet and floppy. But the money that Mr. Storimon showed us was all clean and crisp.\"\nMr. Storimon's face turned bright red. He stood, quiet and ashamed, and then muttered \"It's true. That money was in my overcoat pocket. I knew there wouldn't be any hundreds in there, and I was just mad because no one here respected me.\"\n\"You're under arrest,\" said the police officer sternly.\nThen he took took a bite of his doughnut and said \"Just kidding. But watch yourself next time.\"\nAnd for the first time, the four of us at the bus stop were all laughing at the same thing.\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the “crime.”  \n   • Mr. Storimon claims that a thick wad of $100 bills (and possibly $50s) has vanished from the wallet that had just been returned to him.  \n   • The only question is: Who, if anyone, could have extracted the large-denomination bills while the wallet lay in the puddle or while it was in police custody?\n\n2. List everyone who was on the scene from the moment the wallet left Mr. Storimon’s pocket to the moment he discovered the “missing” money.  \n   • Mr. Storimon himself  \n   • Mick the homeless man  \n   • Danny the skateboarder (left arm in a cast)  \n   • The police officer (holding an enormous, sticky, two-hand doughnut)  \n   • The narrator (but he only observed and never handled the wallet)\n\n3. Opportunity analysis.  \n   • Police officer: From discovery to return he always had one hand occupied by a large, gooey doughnut; the other was busy holding the wallet. No free hand remained to sort bills quickly, and the wallet stayed in plain view.  \n   • Danny: His left hand is completely immobilised in a full cast to the elbow; his right hand was visible, first holding gum, then a skateboard. He never handled the wallet.  \n   • Mick: Thick, bulky mittens would have made the fine finger work of separating a few bills almost impossible and certainly obvious. He, too, never possessed the wallet.  \n   • Narrator: He merely pointed out the wallet’s location; never touched it.  \n   • Mr. Storimon: Had access to both wallet and overcoat pockets at all times. After the wallet was returned he alone handled it long enough to “discover” the missing bills. He could easily substitute dry twenties from his overcoat for any wet money that might still be in the wallet.\n\n4. Physical-evidence clue.  \n   • The wallet had lain in a puddle, so any bills inside should be damp. The bills Mr. Storimon displayed were “clean and crisp”—clearly not from the puddle-soaked wallet; they must have come from somewhere else (his own dry pocket).\n\n5. Motive analysis.  \n   • Mick and Danny would risk arrest for a theft yielding nothing but worthless, wet bills; little motive.  \n   • The police officer would jeopardise his career for a few hundred dollars while surrounded by witnesses; highly unlikely.  \n   • Mr. Storimon, offended by lack of respect, had motive to create a scene, blame the “undesirables,” and re-establish his own authority.\n\n6. Logical deduction.  \n   • Only one person both could and would stage the theft: Mr. Storimon.  \n   • The “missing” money never existed in the wallet after it hit the puddle; he simply claimed it did, substituting the dry twenties to dramatise the loss.\n\nTherefore, he is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMick (the homeless man), Danny (the skateboarder), Police Officer (unnamed), Narrator (unnamed observer), Mr. Albert Storimon\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMr. Albert Storimon\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Mr. Storimon pays the cab driver $20 and accidentally drops his wallet into a puddle while hurrying to the bus stop.  \n• Several minutes later the police officer retrieves the soaked wallet and hands it back.  \n• Annoyed at having embarrassed himself in front of strangers who already show him little respect, Mr. Storimon decides to shift attention—and blame—onto them.  \n• Knowing the bills in the wallet are now soggy, he quietly removes the wet money, slips it into an inner pocket of his overcoat, and replaces it with a stack of dry $20 bills he already carried elsewhere.  \n• He then announces that all his $100 bills are missing, hoping to accuse either the homeless man, the skater, or even the police officer of theft.  \n• The plan unravels when three independent clues surface:  \n  1. The officer couldn’t have used both hands to sort bills (doughnut).  \n  2. Danny couldn’t have fingered bills with an arm in a cast.  \n  3. Mick couldn’t have done it wearing bulky mittens.  \n  4. Most damning: the “missing” bills Mr. Storimon now displays are bone-dry, proving they never came from the puddle-soaked wallet.  \n• Confronted with that evidence, Mr. Storimon admits the deceit. No real theft occurred.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mick: Mittens prevented any delicate bill-sorting; he never touched the wallet.  \n• Danny: Left arm in a cast, right hand visible; never handled the wallet.  \n• Police Officer: One hand held a sticky doughnut throughout, the other held the wallet in full view; could not have rifled bills unnoticed.  \n• Narrator: Merely observed; never physically possessed the wallet.  \nWith no opportunity and no logical motive, none of them could have removed the alleged hundreds. Only Mr. Storimon had both motive and opportunity—and the physical evidence points solely to him.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
