      "content": "Since losing his wife MaryAnn to cancer last year, fifty-nine-year-old Steven Roby had suffered periodic bouts of absentmindedness. This concerned him, as his awareness was decreasing. In their declining years, both Steven’s grandfather and uncle had suffered from Alzheimer’s disease before anybody understood what it was. Doc Harvey, the Roby family doctor for over forty years, was watching him closely. Because of this, added to the stress and grief he experienced in losing MaryAnn, he did not notice at first what was happening on the kitchen keyboard. Steven had lived in the Roby house most of his life. He inherited it from his parents thirty years ago and, because it was so spacious and well constructed, he and MaryAnn decided to make it their home. It was a decision they never regretted. Steven’s father, Steve Sr., had been a locksmith by trade. Within the comfortable family home, Steve had installed ornate locks on all of the six bedroom doors. All of the locks and keys were different in size and appearance, and there were two sets of keys to each room. One key was for the room’s occupant and the other was kept on the antique brass keyboard in the kitchen. As Steve Sr.’s five grandchildren grew up and moved out of the house and into adult life, a family tradition was started: each child would retain the key to his or her room, while its companion key would remain on the brass keyboard. This was a symbolic gesture particularly dear to the heart of MaryAnn, as she felt that it kept her children emotionally attached to their childhood home. Steven often wished that his parents could have lived to see this tradition commence and continue to this day. What Steven had been slow to notice was that lately, somebody had been tampering with the keys. One morning over breakfast, the sunlight coming through the big bay window by the kitchen table highlighted the keyboard, causing the brass keyboard and old fashioned keys to sparkle—something that happened on infrequent occasions. Steven loved those old keys. The oversize locks and the keys that fit them were works of art and constant reminders of his youth. But that morning, Steven saw that the keys were not hung as normal. He knew his memory and awareness were becoming serious issues but was certain he had not moved the keys himself. The keys usually hung with the smallest to the left, with the progressively larger ones hung to the right. The keys were numbered in sequence of size, starting with number 1 as the smallest. Hung normally, the keyed sides faced to the left with the smooth sides to the right. But today the smallest key, key number 1, was hung upside down and key number 3 was hung backwards, with the smooth side to the left. Key number 2 was to the master bedroom, and keys 4 and 5 fitted the locks in the twins’ downstairs bedrooms. Key 6 fit an upstairs bedroom, as did keys 1 and 3. Steven pondered this at the kitchen table for several minutes. Intense concentration helped him fight the onset of dementia and now he had something to figure out. He recalled mentioning to one of his children that he was as keeping something of great value in one of the kids’ bedrooms, but could remember nothing else about the conversation, or about the item of great value he had hidden somewhere. Steven knew he would have to take extraordinary measures to find who was tampering with the keys. It was obvious that one of his children was entering the home when he was away and searching for what he was already calling in his mind, “The Treasure.” So Steven devised a plan. He would hide in the house and wait for whoever was coming in unannounced. A few days later, Steven stayed home on his bowling night. He decided to hide in the upstairs hall closet and wait, hoping for two things: He hoped somebody would show up, and that he or she would come upstairs, where three of the five children’s bedrooms were. About nine o’clock, one of Steven’s two wishes came true. He heard the back door gently open and the soft footsteps that followed. He heard a faint clinking on the keyboard, but the mystery visitor stayed downstairs. The downstairs bedrooms belonged to his twin daughters April and Kirsten. April’s room was on the side of the house Steven was in now, but Kirsten’s was across on the other side of the living room, near the master bedroom. The darkness and quiet of the old house assisted him in hearing the mystery visitor open a door, but the sound seemed to come from far away. About ten minutes later, Steven heard a car pull into the driveway and back out again, obviously there only to turn around. However, the unexpected noise was enough to frighten the mystery visitor, who quickly moved to the kitchen, replaced the key, and fled through the back door. A couple of days later, Steven had let it be known that a doctor’s appointment would keep him away from the house all afternoon. Steven hid in the same upstairs closet. Sure enough, a few minutes after he should have left for his doctor’s appointment, the back door opened and he heard the same soft footsteps and light clinking on the keyboard. This time, the visitor came upstairs and opened a bedroom door, but Steven could not tell which room it was. Steven considered surprising the visitor but wished to know exactly what his child was up to and why. If he called out now, he may never learn the truth. The search was interrupted by the doorbell. Once again, the intruder hastily fled, this time bolting downstairs and departing through the back door but making very little noise. However, a clue was left behind. On the upstairs hall floor, Steven found a silk handkerchief, which appeared to be new. Steven could not tell if it was a man’s or woman’s and it had no fragrance on it. That evening, a frustrated Steven asked his sons Harold and Buddy to come over to help him move an armoire, and then to stay for dinner. He always enjoyed the company of his children, but tonight he wished to look at them in a different and uncomfortable light: all of them were suspects in visiting the Roby home in secret. Harold was first to arrive. Harold was a big man, not well coordinated physically and clumsy in his movements. Steven had hesitated in asking him to assist in moving the heavy armoire, but knew he and Buddy were there to watch him. Buddy arrived a few minutes later, with the watery eyes and runny nose of a cold that had lasted over a week. He was sure it would eventually go away, but in the meantime it was something he was simply going to have to tough out. The men got the armoire moved, dined together, and Steven still had no idea who was sneaking into the house or why, even after asking his sons numerous subtle questions during dinner. The next week, again on bowling night, Steven tried his hiding tactic once more. The mystery intruder didn’t disappoint—Steven heard footsteps coming upstairs and entering a room. He could tell it was the same room from the time before, but wasn’t sure which one it was. Midway through the intruder’s very quiet search, Steven’s telephone rang. This startled not only the intruder, but Steven as well. His arm heavily hit the wall inside the closet and the intruder heard it. Frightened, the mystery Roby relative ran swiftly down the stairs and out of the house, leaving the key in daughter Denise’s bedroom door. Over the course of the next few days, Steven spoke individually with his daughters, being careful not to give away the reason for his visits. Denise showed concern, as she always did, about her dad’s pre-Alzheimer’s condition, and Kirsten seemed to sense something was worrying her father. April sensed something wrong as well. But Steven learned nothing. He knew he would have to pull it together and figure this out. There would be no more secret visits and the guilty child knew Steven suspected something. So, over a tall glass of iced tea after he had spoken to all of his children, Steven began to replay everything he had learned and had happened in his mind. He examined the keyboard again and noticed that key number 4 had dust on it. He also knew that key number 6, which fit Denise’s room, had been used and put away twice. After a couple of hours and two glasses of iced tea, he knew two more things: He knew who was secretly entering the Roby home and why.",

          "reveal_text": "Steven did not wish to make a bigger deal out of this than necessary for many reasons. His first inclination was to call all of his children together and air this out, like a super sleuth in the last chapter of a mystery novel would. But instead he decided to simply invite the guilty one over for a discreet visit.\nOver coffee one evening after dinner, he explained everything from the time he first noticed the keys askew until the night the telephone rang and he clumsily gave himself away. He finished by saying, “I know what you were doing and why. I called you over here to thank you.”\nThe person who had been the mystery intruder smiled and said, “What do you know, and why do you think it was me?”\nSteven grinned and said, “What I know is that I remember telling one of you kids that I stashed an old portrait of your mother in one of your bedrooms, but could not remember which room I put it in. Nor could I remember which of you I told that to. But, once I remembered this, figuring out the rest was easy.” Steven grinned, realizing what he had just said was quite a mouthful.\n“How so?” his child asked, still smiling.\n“Well, I started with the idea that each of you is still familiar with what is in your own rooms. Now, I recall that on the first night, the visitor went to Kirsten’s room. I know that because the sound of the opening door was on the first floor, and seemed far away. Had it been the other bedroom I would have heard more clearly. So, key number 5 was taken off the keyboard and replaced. On the second visit, the intruder dropped a clean handkerchief. I saw Harold and Buddy that evening and Buddy had a cold and runny nose, so it wasn’t him. I noticed on the third visit that, even when frightened and in a hurry, you were very quiet in quickly running downstairs and leaving the house. That for sure would not be your brother Harold, who is very awkward and clumsy. Buddy’s key is number 3 on the board and Harold’s number 1. It wouldn’t be Denise, whose key is number 6 on the board, as the intruder would not be searching her own room for something hidden. Any of you can search your own room any time you are over here and nobody would suspect anything. So, April, it had to be you. Not only are your brothers and sisters eliminated, but your key, key number 4, has dust on it. Room 4 is the only one not eliminated. My question is, why do this on the sneak?\nApril looked at her father with deep affection and replied, “I just wanted to pleasantly surprise you, Dad. I know you have had a tough time, and finding that portrait of Mom would do wonders for your morale.”\nSteven’s heart was warmed by this. He was also grateful there was no ulterior motive in what she had done. Before he could respond, April said, “I’ve been researching Alzheimer’s. Keeping your mind alert is the best thing you can do in fighting it. Perhaps you should become a mystery writer. You solved this one easily enough.”\nSteven reached over and kissed his daughter and said, “No mystery writing in me, but I believe we can find that portrait now.”",

This was a symbolic gesture particularly dear to the heart of MaryAnn, as she felt that it kept her children emotionally attached to their childhood home. Steven often wished that his parents could have lived to see this tradition commence and continue to this day. What Steven had been slow to notice was that lately, somebody had been tampering with the keys. One morning over breakfast, the sunlight coming through the big bay window by the kitchen table highlighted the keyboard, causing the brass keyboard and old fashioned keys to sparkle—something that happened on infrequent occasions. Steven loved those old keys. The oversize locks and the keys that fit them were works of art and constant reminders of his youth. But that morning, Steven saw that the keys were not hung as normal. He knew his memory and awareness were becoming serious issues but was certain he had not moved the keys himself. The keys usually hung with the smallest to the left, with the progressively larger ones hung to the right. The keys were numbered in sequence of size, starting with number 1 as the smallest. Hung normally, the keyed sides faced to the left with the smooth sides to the right. But today the smallest key, key number 1, was hung upside down and key number 3 was hung backwards, with the smooth side to the left. Key number 2 was to the master bedroom, and keys 4 and 5 fitted the locks in the twins’ downstairs bedrooms. Key 6 fit an upstairs bedroom, as did keys 1 and 3. Steven pondered this at the kitchen table for several minutes. Intense concentration helped him fight the onset of dementia and now he had something to figure out. He recalled mentioning to one of his children that he was as keeping something of great value in one of the kids’ bedrooms, but could remember nothing else about the conversation, or about the item of great value he had hidden somewhere. Steven knew he would have to take extraordinary measures to find who was tampering with the keys. It was obvious that one of his children was entering the home when he was away and searching for what he was already calling in his mind, “The Treasure.” So Steven devised a plan. He would hide in the house and wait for whoever was coming in unannounced. A few days later, Steven stayed home on his bowling night. He decided to hide in the upstairs hall closet and wait, hoping for two things: He hoped somebody would show up, and that he or she would come upstairs, where three of the five children’s bedrooms were. About nine o’clock, one of Steven’s two wishes came true. He heard the back door gently open and the soft footsteps that followed. He heard a faint clinking on the keyboard, but the mystery visitor stayed downstairs. The downstairs bedrooms belonged to his twin daughters April and Kirsten. April’s room was on the side of the house Steven was in now, but Kirsten’s was across on the other side of the living room, near the master bedroom. The darkness and quiet of the old house assisted him in hearing the mystery visitor open a door, but the sound seemed to come from far away. About ten minutes later, Steven heard a car pull into the driveway and back out again, obviously there only to turn around. However, the unexpected noise was enough to frighten the mystery visitor, who quickly moved to the kitchen, replaced the key, and fled through the back door. A couple of days later, Steven had let it be known that a doctor’s appointment would keep him away from the house all afternoon. Steven hid in the same upstairs closet. Sure enough, a few minutes after he should have left for his doctor’s appointment, the back door opened and he heard the same soft footsteps and light clinking on the keyboard. This time, the visitor came upstairs and opened a bedroom door, but Steven could not tell which room it was. Steven considered surprising the visitor but wished to know exactly what his child was up to and why. If he called out now, he may never learn the truth. The search was interrupted by the doorbell. Once again, the intruder hastily fled, this time bolting downstairs and departing through the back door but making very little noise. However, a clue was left behind. On the upstairs hall floor, Steven found a silk handkerchief, which appeared to be new. Steven could not tell if it was a man’s or woman’s and it had no fragrance on it. That evening, a frustrated Steven asked his sons Harold and Buddy to come over to help him move an armoire, and then to stay for dinner. He always enjoyed the company of his children, but tonight he wished to look at them in a different and uncomfortable light: all of them were suspects in visiting the Roby home in secret. Harold was first to arrive. Harold was a big man, not well coordinated physically and clumsy in his movements. Steven had hesitated in asking him to assist in moving the heavy armoire, but knew he and Buddy were there to watch him. Buddy arrived a few minutes later, with the watery eyes and runny nose of a cold that had lasted over a week. He was sure it would eventually go away, but in the meantime it was something he was simply going to have to tough out. The men got the armoire moved, dined together, and Steven still had no idea who was sneaking into the house or why, even after asking his sons numerous subtle questions during dinner. The next week, again on bowling night, Steven tried his hiding tactic once more. The mystery intruder didn’t disappoint—Steven heard footsteps coming upstairs and entering a room. He could tell it was the same room from the time before, but wasn’t sure which one it was. Midway through the intruder’s very quiet search, Steven’s telephone rang. This startled not only the intruder, but Steven as well. His arm heavily hit the wall inside the closet and the intruder heard it. Frightened, the mystery Roby relative ran swiftly down the stairs and out of the house, leaving the key in daughter Denise’s bedroom door. Over the course of the next few days, Steven spoke individually with his daughters, being careful not to give away the reason for his visits. Denise showed concern, as she always did, about her dad’s pre-Alzheimer’s condition, and Kirsten seemed to sense something was worrying her father. April sensed something wrong as well. But Steven learned nothing. He knew he would have to pull it together and figure this out. There would be no more secret visits and the guilty child knew Steven suspected something. So, over a tall glass of iced tea after he had spoken to all of his children, Steven began to replay everything he had learned and had happened in his mind. He examined the keyboard again and noticed that key number 4 had dust on it. He also knew that key number 6, which fit Denise’s room, had been used and put away twice. After a couple of hours and two glasses of iced tea, he knew two more things: He knew who was secretly entering the Roby home and why.\nSteven did not wish to make a bigger deal out of this than necessary for many reasons. His first inclination was to call all of his children together and air this out, like a super sleuth in the last chapter of a mystery novel would. But instead he decided to simply invite the guilty one over for a discreet visit.\nOver coffee one evening after dinner, he explained everything from the time he first noticed the keys askew until the night the telephone rang and he clumsily gave himself away. He finished by saying, “I know what you were doing and why. I called you over here to thank you.”\nThe person who had been the mystery intruder smiled and said, “What do you know, and why do you think it was me?”\nSteven grinned and said, “What I know is that I remember telling one of you kids that I stashed an old portrait of your mother in one of your bedrooms, but could not remember which room I put it in. Nor could I remember which of you I told that to. But, once I remembered this, figuring out the rest was easy.” Steven grinned, realizing what he had just said was quite a mouthful.\n“How so?” his child asked, still smiling.\n“Well, I started with the idea that each of you is still familiar with what is in your own rooms. Now, I recall that on the first night, the visitor went to Kirsten’s room. I know that because the sound of the opening door was on the first floor, and seemed far away. Had it been the other bedroom I would have heard more clearly. So, key number 5 was taken off the keyboard and replaced. On the second visit, the intruder dropped a clean handkerchief. I saw Harold and Buddy that evening and Buddy had a cold and runny nose, so it wasn’t him. I noticed on the third visit that, even when frightened and in a hurry, you were very quiet in quickly running downstairs and leaving the house. That for sure would not be your brother Harold, who is very awkward and clumsy. Buddy’s key is number 3 on the board and Harold’s number 1. It wouldn’t be Denise, whose key is number 6 on the board, as the intruder would not be searching her own room for something hidden. Any of you can search your own room any time you are over here and nobody would suspect anything. So, April, it had to be you. Not only are your brothers and sisters eliminated, but your key, key number 4, has dust on it. Room 4 is the only one not eliminated. My question is, why do this on the sneak?\nApril looked at her father with deep affection and replied, “I just wanted to pleasantly surprise you, Dad. I know you have had a tough time, and finding that portrait of Mom would do wonders for your morale.”\nSteven’s heart was warmed by this. He was also grateful there was no ulterior motive in what she had done. Before he could respond, April said, “I’ve been researching Alzheimer’s. Keeping your mind alert is the best thing you can do in fighting it. Perhaps you should become a mystery writer. You solved this one easily enough.”\nSteven reached over and kissed his daughter and said, “No mystery writing in me, but I believe we can find that portrait now.”\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is. Explain your reasoning step by step, considering:\n1. The motives of different characters\n2. The opportunities each character had\n3. Any physical evidence or alibis\n4.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Only one of the five Roby children had a reason that was strictly benevolent: to locate the old portrait of their late mother and return it to cheer up their father.  \n   • Nothing was taken; the bedrooms were only being examined.  That points to an affectionate rather than criminal motive.\n\n2. Opportunity & physical clues  \n   • Night-1 – the door that opened was downstairs and “far away.”  That can only be Kirsten’s room (key-5).  Therefore the searcher is not Kirsten.  \n   • Night-2 – a brand-new silk handkerchief is dropped.  Buddy had a cold and would be carrying used tissues, not a pristine silk square; Harold is too clumsy to lose nothing else.  \n   • Night-3 – the prowler races downstairs “swiftly” and “very quiet.”  Harold, a big, awkward man, could not move that silently; this also keeps Denise in the clear because the key that is left in the lock is her own (key-6) – she would not need to unlock her own room.  \n   • Keyboard dust – after the three incursions every key shows fingerprints except key-4 (April’s).  The simplest explanation is that the intruder already owns the duplicate of key-4 and never has to touch the spare on the board.\n\n3. Eliminating suspects  \n   Harold – ruled out by his physical clumsiness and the intruder’s quiet flight.  \n   Buddy – ruled out by the clean silk handkerchief and by the fact that key-3 (his) was disturbed only once at the very start and never again.  \n   Kirsten – her own room was searched the first night; she would know the portrait wasn’t there.  \n   Denise – her room was being searched the third night; her spare key was left in the door.\n\n4. Logical outcome  \n   The only child left who fits every fact is April.  She is quiet and graceful, carries the sort of new silk handkerchief that was found, already possesses her own key, and would naturally want to surprise her father with the missing portrait.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nHarold Roby, Buddy Roby, Denise Roby, Kirsten Roby, April Roby\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nApril Roby\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter hearing her father say he had hidden an old portrait of their mother in one of the children’s bedrooms but could not remember which, April decided to find it herself so she could present it to him as a loving surprise.  \n• Visit 1 (bowling night): With her own duplicate key-4 in her purse, April entered through the back door, took spare key-5 from the kitchen board, and searched Kirsten’s downstairs room.  A car turned in the driveway; frightened, she rehung the key and left.  \n• Visit 2 (fake doctor appointment): She again came in, this time upstairs, used spare key-6 and began to search Denise’s room.  The door-bell rang; she dropped a brand-new silk handkerchief in the upstairs hall, rehung key-6, and slipped out unseen.  \n• Visit 3 (second bowling night): April returned, unlocked Denise’s room with key-6 once more, but Steven’s telephone rang; in the rush she forgot the key in the lock, ran quietly downstairs and escaped.  \nThroughout she never removed dusty key-4 because she already had her own copy; nor could she be heard lumbering about like Harold, nor did she carry a used tissue like Buddy.  Her sole aim was to recover the portrait, not steal anything, and to do it secretly so it would be a happy surprise for her father.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nHarold Roby – His size and awkwardness make silent movement impossible; the prowler moved with speed and little noise, and Harold was helping his father move furniture at the time the silk handkerchief was already lost, proving he wasn’t the intruder.  \n\nBuddy Roby – He had a severe head cold; a person suffering that would have carried crumpled tissues, not a brand-new silk handkerchief left behind.  Moreover, key-3 (his) showed initial disturbance but no subsequent use, inconsistent with a systematic search.  \n\nDenise Roby – The spare key to her own room (key-6) was used twice and finally left stuck in her lock.  Denise would not need to unlock her own bedroom with the board key, so she cannot be the intruder.  \n\nKirsten Roby – Her downstairs room was the first one searched; had she been the prowler she would know the portrait was not there and would have no need to begin her hunt in her own quarters.  \n\nOnly April’s actions, opportunity, gracefulness, and possession of her duplicate key explain every clue without contradiction.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
