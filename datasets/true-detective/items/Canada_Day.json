      "content": "The beach was crowded, and Glen had to be careful as he maneuvered in and out and around the multitude of bathers and sun-worshippers with his metal detector. It was a hot day even for July 1st, not a cloud in the sky and that had brought out the hordes anxious to escape the nitty-gritty furnace of the city. It was only eleven in the morning, but Glen had already made a pretty good haul – $4.65 in loose change, a pair of slightly bent sunglasses, one fully functioning watch and two rings (one of which appeared to be at least 10K gold). People sometimes made fun of Glen as he scouted around with his long-handled magnetic machine, sweeping it back and forth over the ground, headphones on, listening for the beeping sound that signaled buried metal. But he looked at it this way: not only was he enriching himself to a certain extent (to supplement his meager teacher’s pension) and getting some much-needed exercise, but he was also providing a community service. Because along with the valuables, he also uncovered and removed from the dirt or the sand loose can pull-tabs, bottle caps and openers, misplaced keys and other sharp metal objects which could cut unsuspecting bare feet or other body parts, if stepped on or fallen on the wrong way. Glen pushed back the floppy brim of his Tilley hat and mopped his forehead, promising himself a hot dog and cold soda for lunch with the money he’d found. He was up by the entrance to the beach, and as he bent his head and machine back down, he noticed a plastic bag sticking out of the sand about ten feet to his left. Often his bespectacled eyes were just as adept as his metal-detecting machine at finding treasure, and such was the case here. Because as Glen bent down and pulled the sealed plastic sandwich bag out of the sand, he saw that it contained money – lots of it, in bills and coins. He grinned, eyes lighting up like a slot machine that’s hit Jackpot! Then he frowned slightly, noting that the brightly colored bills and large golden and silver coins weren’t good ol’ American greenbacks and change, but rather Canadian currency. Sadly, they were not legal tender in Nebraska, where Glen lived. But the money could still be exchanged at a bank for American cash (at a slight discount, given the Canadian dollar’s lower value relative to the US dollar). Glen’s grin went back up again, as he prepared to open the baggie and count up his loot. Suddenly, though, he was surrounded by four fellow beachgoers who’d seen him pick up the moneybag. They closed in on him, loudly proclaiming the dough as their own. Glen quickly stashed the found money in his fanny pack for safekeeping and then held up his hand. “Hold on, folks!” he addressed the two men, one woman and one child, all of whom were clad in nothing but swimsuits. “What do you mean ‘hold on’?” the stocky blonde man protested. “That’s my money. It dropped out of my pants pocket on my way onto the beach. Now give it here!” “Not so fast, Blondie,” the redheaded woman cut in. “That’s my cash. I put it in the plastic baggie so I could bury it in the sand beneath my clothing – so it wouldn’t get stolen when I went swimming. But I lost it on my way down to the beach.” “That money’s mine, mister!” the tall bald man exclaimed. “I keep it in a plastic baggie when I go to the beach so it doesn’t get wet. I’m Canadian. I’d show you my passport … but I don’t have it with me.” He gestured at his swim trunks. “I’m Canadian, too,” the little black-haired girl stated, looking forlornly up at Glen. “My parents and I are visiting my sick Grandmother down here. That’s all the money I brought with me to buy presents for her. I put it in a plastic bag to take to the bank to change into American money.” She reached for Glen’s fanny pack. He took a step back, holding his metal detector up as a barrier to the avarice crowd. As a former schoolteacher, he knew a little something about the Great White North, having taught North American studies in high school for years. So, like all teachers, he felt that a pop quiz was in order, to identify the true Canuck owner of the Canadian currency. “How many provinces are there in Canada, young lady?” he asked the little black-haired girl. “Ten,” she promptly replied, smiling sweetly. “And what’s the capital city of Canada?” “Toronto,” she responded, just as confidently. Glen turned to the stocky blonde man. “What are Canada’s two official languages, sir?” The man grunted and grinned. “They are English and French, of course.” “And who was the earliest European explorer to discover Canada?” “You mean besides the Vikings?” He scratched his chin. “Well, it was, of course … Jacques Cartier.” He held out a hand for the cash. Glen moved on to the tall bald man, giving nothing away. “What’s on the Canadian flag, sir?” “It is a maple leaf,” the man instantly answered, “a red maple leaf.” “And what is the largest lake situated entirely in your country?” Glen asked. The man hesitated, turning even redder than his sunburn. “Uh, well, that’s kind of a tough one …” The little black-haired girl giggled. “Let’s see, Lake Winnipeg is quite large. And there’s, uh, Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake, up in the Northwest Territories.” He shrugged. “To be honest, I’m not a hundred percent sure which is the largest.” The redheaded woman snorted. “Honest, he says.” “Okay,” Glen said, turning to her. “Does Canada have a President, like we do?” The woman smiled. “What is this, twenty questions? We have a Prime Minister.” “And whose picture is on the Canadian one-dollar bill, madam?” “The one-dollar bill? Why, um, that would be … the Queen!” Glen unzipped his fanny pack and pulled out the plastic baggie full of Canadian currency. “I can now return this to its rightful owner,” he stated.",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. What is the “crime”?  \n   Somebody who is NOT the true owner of the plastic bag full of Canadian money is trying to trick Glen into handing it over.  Our job is to decide which claimant is the liar (the culprit) and who really lost the cash.\n\n2. What do we actually know about the money?  \n• It was in a ZIP-type sandwich bag.  \n• It was bone-dry and only partly embedded in the sand.  \n• It lay close to the entrance path to the beach, where people leave the board-walk, kick off their shoes and shed street clothes.  \n• It was NOT deeply buried; the corner of the bag was sticking out where Glen could see it.\n\n3. How do the four stories stack up against those facts?  \n\nA. Stocky blond man  \n   – Says it fell from the pocket of his trousers “on my way onto the beach.”  \n   – That would put it exactly where Glen found it: near the entrance and only lightly covered by drifting sand.  \n   – Clothes with pockets are normally removed right at the top of the sand; dropping something there is believable.  \n   – Does not claim to have taken the money into the water, so the bag should be perfectly dry – which it is.  \n   – Only weakness: he is vague on why he is carrying Canadian currency. Silly but not impossible for a tourist or truck-driver living in Nebraska.  \n\nB. Red-haired woman  \n   – Says she buried the packet “beneath my clothing so it wouldn’t be stolen when I went swimming” but “lost it on my way down to the beach.”  \n   – If she buried it, it would still be where her towel and clothes are, not near the entrance.  \n   – If she lost it while walking, it would not already be half-buried.  \n\nC. Little black-haired girl  \n   – Claims she was taking the cash to a bank “to change into American money.”  \n   – A child lugging a bag of loose bills and coins to a bank and then stopping off at the beach first is unlikely.  \n   – Same location objection: why would she drop it at the entrance and not notice immediately?  \n\nD. Tall bald man  \n   – Says he keeps his money “in a plastic baggie when I go to the beach so it doesn’t get wet.”  \n   – If he had really been in the water, the outside of the bag would be damp and the sand stuck to it differently; Glen handled it and never mentioned moisture.  \n   – If he had been carrying it in his swim-trunk pocket, he would have lost it down by the water line, not up at the entry path.  \n\n4. Who was able to “pass” Glen’s Canadian‐trivia quiz?  \n   Only the tall bald man.  But Glen’s quiz merely tests Canadian general knowledge, not ownership.  Anyone could mug up those facts, while the true owner might know nothing about Canada.  Therefore the quiz result is worthless as real evidence.\n\n5. Opportunity + physical evidence trump a trivia quiz.  \n   The only story that fits every physical fact (exact place, partial burial, dryness) is the blond man’s.  Everyone else’s tale conflicts with at least one definite observation.\n\n6. Motive.  \n   The tall bald man had the most to gain (a large wad of cash) and, after hearing Glen start a “Canadian test,” instantly saw how to pass it.  He tried to dazzle Glen with correct answers, even prepping himself by mentioning “I’m Canadian” and “passport … but I don’t have it.”  That is exactly how a quick-thinking con-man behaves.\n\n7. Conclusion.  \n   The tall bald man engineered the deception.  He is the culprit; the money almost certainly belongs to the stocky blond man, whose only “crime” is not knowing his Canadian history.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nTall bald man, Stocky blond man, Red-haired woman, Little black-haired girl, Glen the metal-detector hobbyist\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nTall bald man\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• The stocky blond visitor arrived at the beach in ordinary street clothes.  \n• As he stepped off the board-walk, he took off his trousers, shook them, and the bag of Canadian money slipped from the pocket without his noticing.  A few passing feet kicked a thin layer of sand over it; one corner remained visible.  \n• Glen’s sharp eyes spotted the bag and he picked it up.  \n• The tall bald man, seeing easy money, hurried over and claimed it.  Hearing three other people also claim it, he realised he needed an edge and immediately played the “I’m Canadian” card.  \n• When Glen began quizzing them, the bald man answered every question correctly (basic tourist-guide information), fooling Glen into thinking he must be the rightful owner.  \n• In reality the facts of location and condition of the money show that the blond man’s account is the only plausible one; the bald man was staging an opportunistic fraud.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nStocky blond man – His account fits the physical evidence; ignorance of Canadian history does not make him a thief.  \nRed-haired woman – Her “buried it under my clothes” story is contradicted by where the bag lay, but there is no sign she deliberately planted false information; she merely grabbed at a chance windfall.  \nLittle black-haired girl – A child repeating a fanciful story; no proof of criminal intent and unlikely to have concocted a sophisticated con.  \nGlen – Naïve in his “pop-quiz” method but acted in good faith and had no motive to steal; he was ready to hand the money over to someone else.  \nOnly the tall bald man constructed a polished, intentionally deceptive story that clashes with the observable facts, making him the sole deliberate culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

He’s the only one who didn’t answer any of Glen’s questions incorrectly; questions that most, if not all, Canadian citizens would know the answers to.\nOttawa is, in fact, the capital of Canada, not Toronto (Canada’s largest city), as the little black-haired girl said. And John Cabot was actually the first European explorer to reach Canada, in 1497. Not Jacques Cartier, as the stocky blonde man stated (Cartier didn’t reach the New World until 1534). And the Queen is indeed on the Canadian dollar, as the redheaded woman said, only Canada doesn’t have one-dollar ‘bills’, they have one-dollar ‘coins’ – loonies, as Canadians call them, because of the loon depicted on the opposite side of the coin from the Queen.\nThe tall bald man was correct about there being a red Maple Leaf on his country’s flag. And while he couldn’t name the exact Canadian lake that is the largest – a tough question even for Canadians – he did mention it: Great Bear Lake."
