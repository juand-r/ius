      "content": "Bill Morris was in an expansive mood after the fine dinner we had just enjoyed. After the dishes were cleared, we sat by the fireplace. His eyes showed that he was far, far away. We were old friends, he and his wife Susan, and Mary and I. Mr. and Mrs. Tom Johnston, if you want a formal introduction. “It happened during our trip to Scotland last fall. We were anxious, Susan and I, to enjoy ourselves during this long-planned trip. So much so that when the recession hit, and things were a bit tighter than usual, we decided to go regardless. We knew that the money we spent would leave us with memories of our trip. It turned out that we returned with far more than that.” That got our attention. Mary was about to ask what had happened when Bill came out of his daydream and told the story, confidential-like. It struck me that had any strangers been present with us around the fire, the story would never have been told. “We were by the lakes, you know. Loch Lomond—that region, where there are treacherous moors as well—just like in the west of England, the Baskerville country. Yes, a man could get lost there.” We nodded, shivering a bit. “As a matter of fact, seven generations or so ago, one did!” Mary had to interrupt. “How did you find this out? And who was it?” “I followed the clues. You do so too, and see if you can tell me. But to begin with, of course you remember Susan’s maiden name, Susan Alice Macready?” Susan beamed with Celtic pride as I explained to Mary, whom I hadn’t known at the time of Susan and Bill’s wedding, “Of course! And at your wedding, nothing would do but we all wore formal Scottish attire, kilts, sporrans and all. There was a piper as well, playing as we gathered at the church.” “That’s right,” Susan said softly. “And now you’ll see, this was the trip I so wanted to take, to rediscover where my ancestor James Macready came from, so many years ago.” “It was in a little village, on the edge of the moors, quaint and folkloric in its way. It made me think of Brigadoon,” Bill said. “This was the town that James Macready had come from, so many years ago. Well anyway, we started up a conversation with the local innkeeper. We asked after the Macready family. “His answer astonished us. ‘They’re all gone,’ he said. ‘They died out many years ago. The last one was James Macready, who was lost on the moor. If you don’t believe me, take a look at our local churchyard cemetery. And there will be the records in the church office.’ “Amazed, we left the inn and walked over to the churchyard. It was just as the innkeeper had said. There were plots for a few families: Macready, Doone, Jenkins and MacGinnis. The last Macready was ‘James Macready, 1823–1844. Lost on the Moor.’ At our discovery of this grave, Susan gave a cry and nearly fainted. She had brought a copy of the family’s American genealogy, which began with the arrival of this very same James Macready in 1845. He had been born in Scotland in 1823, and died on the family farm in Pennsylvania in 1863, of wounds that he had received during the Civil War, at the First Battle of Bull Run, in 1861. It wasn’t possible that he had never come to America at all. If he had not, then just who did come and start the Macready family line in Pennsylvania?” “We stayed at the old inn, prolonging our visit, and talked with several locals with long memories. They remembered hearing the old stories from their grandparents, who had surely heard the same stories around the fireplace, like this one. The stories were memorized, with a detail or two added over the years for local color.” “Good thing it wasn’t a gas fireplace at that inn in Scotland,” I ventured. “That would upset the mood, I’m sure. Real stories require wood fires!” Mary shot a disapproving look at me, and Bill continued. “It seems that there were three suitors for a pretty—” “No, beautiful!” Susan interjected. Bill smiled. “Yes, a beautiful local girl named Lucille Doone. Whether this was the same family as that lawless one in the west of England, I can’t say. But they had something of the same rough and ready traditions. Her brother, Samuel Doone, always said that if anyone didn’t do right by his sister, that person would have to answer to him—and his hunting knife. “The suitors were James Macready, Tom Jenkins, and Jack MacGinnis. Their rivalry became well known—it was jealous and bitter. It was thought that Lucille Doone had made a choice, but if she had, she didn’t let on. Townspeople speculated that harm would come to the man whom Lucille chose, by the hands of those spurned. Rather than risk her beloved being killed, Lucille kept her own confidence. And so the mens’ rivalry continued. “Until the night James Macready was supposed to have been lost—for the locals spoke of it as though it had been no more than a week ago, and certainly within their living memory. There had been a country dance at a local farmhouse, and everyone was there. It was said that Lucille Doone would announce her choice of suitors then. The dancing to the fiddler’s tune was fast, and the time slipped by. Then came midnight, and the music stopped. Lucille Doone announced her choice—it was James Macready! “Jack MacGinnis left first. He grumbled about the lateness of the hour. He never went out without his dogs, and they could be heard barking as MacGinnis walked the half mile or so to his own farm. “James Macready left next. He was going straight over the moor, which everyone always said should never be attempted at night, it was that treacherous. But it was a full moon, and with the excitement, and a wedding now to think of, he wanted to put his affairs in order. He chastely bid Lucille goodbye and was never seen again. There was just the scarf that she had given him when she made her announcement—it was found tied to a tree branch along a pathway in the middle of the moor. That’s how the people knew what happened to poor James. “The last suitor to leave was Tom Jenkins. From the name, you will have suspected that he was an Englishman, and that he was, sure enough. Or rather, his grandparents were, when they had settled here. Now, English or not, we were told that you’d not find a better Scots family than the Jenkinses. Tom was hotblooded and a crack shot with his rifle, which he always carried with him. “Samuel escorted his sister home at the close of the dance, assuring that she made it safely. The next morning, Lucille kept waiting for her betrothed, James Macready, to call. He didn’t. And he hadn’t turned up at home, either. A search party was formed, for the daytime, of course. There seemed to be no clues for what had happened that quiet night on the moor. The search took five days, but finally, Lucille’s scarf was found and James was presumed lost. Lucille herself wore black at the funeral in remembrance of her lost love and the wedding that was never held. After a few months, Lucille heard from her aunt in Glasgow and moved there. It was said that the small village held too many sad memories for her to stay on. “That was that, except for the fact that suspicions were such that neither Tom Jenkins nor Jack MacGinnis could stay in the little town either. With Lucille gone to Glasgow, there just wasn’t any point in doing so. They did leave families here, and, it is said, wrote from time to time, but the letters were not saved, and a fire at the old library, which had housed records from the time, meant that nobody could be quite sure what had happened. “And so the legends began. And now it’s your turn. Perhaps you know, as Susan and I now do, just which man came to America under the Macready name and what happened on the Scottish moor so many years ago?”",

The stories were memorized, with a detail or two added over the years for local color.” “Good thing it wasn’t a gas fireplace at that inn in Scotland,” I ventured. “That would upset the mood, I’m sure. Real stories require wood fires!” Mary shot a disapproving look at me, and Bill continued. “It seems that there were three suitors for a pretty—” “No, beautiful!” Susan interjected. Bill smiled. “Yes, a beautiful local girl named Lucille Doone. Whether this was the same family as that lawless one in the west of England, I can’t say. But they had something of the same rough and ready traditions. Her brother, Samuel Doone, always said that if anyone didn’t do right by his sister, that person would have to answer to him—and his hunting knife. “The suitors were James Macready, Tom Jenkins, and Jack MacGinnis. Their rivalry became well known—it was jealous and bitter. It was thought that Lucille Doone had made a choice, but if she had, she didn’t let on. Townspeople speculated that harm would come to the man whom Lucille chose, by the hands of those spurned. Rather than risk her beloved being killed, Lucille kept her own confidence. And so the mens’ rivalry continued. “Until the night James Macready was supposed to have been lost—for the locals spoke of it as though it had been no more than a week ago, and certainly within their living memory. There had been a country dance at a local farmhouse, and everyone was there. It was said that Lucille Doone would announce her choice of suitors then. The dancing to the fiddler’s tune was fast, and the time slipped by. Then came midnight, and the music stopped. Lucille Doone announced her choice—it was James Macready! “Jack MacGinnis left first. He grumbled about the lateness of the hour. He never went out without his dogs, and they could be heard barking as MacGinnis walked the half mile or so to his own farm. “James Macready left next. He was going straight over the moor, which everyone always said should never be attempted at night, it was that treacherous. But it was a full moon, and with the excitement, and a wedding now to think of, he wanted to put his affairs in order. He chastely bid Lucille goodbye and was never seen again. There was just the scarf that she had given him when she made her announcement—it was found tied to a tree branch along a pathway in the middle of the moor. That’s how the people knew what happened to poor James. “The last suitor to leave was Tom Jenkins. From the name, you will have suspected that he was an Englishman, and that he was, sure enough. Or rather, his grandparents were, when they had settled here. Now, English or not, we were told that you’d not find a better Scots family than the Jenkinses. Tom was hotblooded and a crack shot with his rifle, which he always carried with him. “Samuel escorted his sister home at the close of the dance, assuring that she made it safely. The next morning, Lucille kept waiting for her betrothed, James Macready, to call. He didn’t. And he hadn’t turned up at home, either. A search party was formed, for the daytime, of course. There seemed to be no clues for what had happened that quiet night on the moor. The search took five days, but finally, Lucille’s scarf was found and James was presumed lost. Lucille herself wore black at the funeral in remembrance of her lost love and the wedding that was never held. After a few months, Lucille heard from her aunt in Glasgow and moved there. It was said that the small village held too many sad memories for her to stay on. “That was that, except for the fact that suspicions were such that neither Tom Jenkins nor Jack MacGinnis could stay in the little town either. With Lucille gone to Glasgow, there just wasn’t any point in doing so. They did leave families here, and, it is said, wrote from time to time, but the letters were not saved, and a fire at the old library, which had housed records from the time, meant that nobody could be quite sure what had happened. “And so the legends began. And now it’s your turn. Perhaps you know, as Susan and I now do, just which man came to America under the Macready name and what happened on the Scottish moor so many years ago?”\nBill took in our rapt faces, Mary’s and mine, and grinned.\n“Why, I’ve no idea!” I cried. “Please don’t let this mystery stand a moment longer!”\n“I’ve given you all the detail you need,” Bill said. “Did one of the two unlucky suitors, or Lucille’s own brother, kill James Macready on the moor and then leave the country, taking the dead man’s name?\n“Jack MacGinnis never went out without his dogs, and their barking would have been a clear sign that he had gone out again and murdered Macready. Tom Jenkins was hotblooded, but his weapon was a rifle. No shot was reported heard.\n“A knife is a silent weapon, so Samuel Doone could not be exonerated by that fact alone—but he escorted his sister home that evening. Surely he couldn’t have killed her suitor. But think of this: the fact that Lucille Doone’s scarf was found neatly tied to a tree branch shows planning. If James Macready had lost his way, the scarf would have been found on the path, not deliberately tied onto a branch. It was left to make others believe that he had been lost on the moor. In fact, there was a full moon that night, and Macready could have seen the way home clearly enough.\nKnowing how hotblooded the suitors were, Lucille and James Macready conspired a safe way to be together. They told her brother Samuel of their plan to fake his disappearance. James Macready had not been lost on the moors; in fact, Macready left the area and made his way to America.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nThe puzzle looks like a classic “whodunit”, but the sting in the tail is that the family tree in Pennsylvania proves the supposedly dead man was alive a year later on another continent.  \nTherefore the first thing to decide is whether any killing took place at all.  \n\n1. Motive  \n   • Jack MacGinnis – jealousy; he lost the girl.  \n   • Tom Jenkins – same jealousy; known to be “hot-blooded.”  \n   • Samuel Doone – might avenge his sister if she were jilted.  \n   • Lucille Doone & James Macready – motive to avoid being separated or murdered by the two rejected suitors.  \n2. Opportunity / Means  \n   • Jack – would have had to leave the farmhouse twice. If he had, his pack of dogs would have been heard barking a second time. No such barking is mentioned.  \n   • Tom – always carried a rifle. A rifle shot would have echoed for miles on a still, moon-lit night, but no shot was reported.  \n   • Samuel – escorted Lucille home immediately after the dance; he was accounted for.  \n   • Lucille & James – both free to arrange the “disappearance”; neither needed a noisy weapon.  \n3. Physical evidence  \n   • Scarf was not dropped, but carefully tied to a branch—an obvious signal, not an accidental loss.  \n   • Full moon: a competent local like James would not normally lose his way on a clear night.  \n   • U.S. records show “James Macready” marrying Lucille Doone in Pennsylvania in 1845 and dying there in 1863.  \n4. Logical deduction  \n   • The simplest explanation consistent with all facts is that no murder occurred.  \n   • The scarf, the moon-light, and the lack of noise point to a staged disappearance.  \n   • Only the couple themselves had both the motive (safety and a future together) and the opportunity to stage it.  \n   • Hence the “culprit” is not a killer at all, but the man who pretended to be a victim in order to elope.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJames Macready, Lucille Doone, Jack MacGinnis, Tom Jenkins, Samuel Doone\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJames Macready   (alias “the late James Macready”)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nBefore the dance, Lucille Doone and her chosen suitor, James Macready, realised that whichever man she selected might be attacked by the two disappointed rivals.  \nThey therefore devised a plan:  \n• At midnight Lucille would publicly name James.  \n• Jack MacGinnis would leave first (with his noisy dogs); Tom Jenkins would leave later with his rifle.  \n• James would announce he was going “straight across the moor,” then slip away along a side path with Lucille’s scarf.  \n• A short distance onto the moor he deliberately tied the scarf to a branch as a planted “clue” that he had become lost.  \n• He waited in hiding until the others were home, then travelled south, took ship, and reached America under his own name.  \n• A few weeks later Lucille, pretending grief, moved to her aunt’s in Glasgow, booked passage, and re-joined James in Pennsylvania in 1845.  \n• The villagers, finding the scarf but no body, concluded James had perished. The rivals, tainted by suspicion, left the district; the legend of the “lost Macready” was born.  \n• In reality the couple lived happily in Pennsylvania; James fought in the Civil War and died of his wounds in 1863, founding the American branch of the family.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nJack MacGinnis – Would have had to return across the moor after already leaving with his barking dogs; no second bout of barking was heard.  \nTom Jenkins – His only weapon was a rifle; no gunshot was heard that night.  \nSamuel Doone – Escorted his sister home and remained with her; he could not be on the moor simultaneously.  \nLucille Doone – An accomplice but not a murderer; she helped her fiancé fake the disappearance, not kill him.  \nThus none of them killed anyone, because no killing ever took place. The sole “culprit” was James Macready, who engineered his own vanishing act.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
