      "content": "It all started when my parents went back to the old country, Poland, for a summer visit. They enjoyed themselves and came back somewhat enlightened, with all sorts of ideas. One of these ideas was to celebrate the story of the Three Wise Men, sometimes called the Three Kings. Now, I’ll have you know, I wasn’t very enthusiastic about all of this. What I really wanted was the kitten I’d asked Santa for. The kitten that Santa, unfortunately, forgot to bring to me on Christmas. My parents, though, didn’t think I was responsible enough for a pet of my own. Or so they said on Christmas day. My father relented just a bit: “Sarah, if you can solve the mystery of the Three Kings, you’ll get your kitten. It all happens on Twelfth Night, the 6th of January. That’s when they arrived at Bethlehem after the birth of Jesus. In Poland and some other countries, they remember Twelfth Night, and celebrate it just as much as they do Christmas.” Well, if that meant a second chance to get my Christmas present right, I was all for it! Mother relayed that we would have a special dinner that night, a traditional Polish dinner, with the biggest broiled fish I ever saw. “Eat your dinner, and maybe you’ll grow bigger than your parents did!” she said. Dinner was delicious. There was a cake for dessert, and just before it was served, we had visitors -- three of them, in ancient costumes. “We are the Three Kings, come to bless your house, just as we visited in Bethlehem so long ago. We have come from far, far away.” I looked with astonishment at the apparitions in the doorway. First there was Caspar of Tarsus, a young man with a full beard. “I bring gold,” he said, “for the new king.” He was huge, vigorous and athletic looking, despite the costume. “I am Melchoir of Persia,” said the second man. He was closer to my father’s age, and he looked like one of Dad’s bowling cronies, behind the turban that he wore. “I bring myrrh, the bitter herb.” He had funny looking slippers on, close fitting, with a tassel on the end by the toes. They were still a bit wet from the snow. And the third man seemed older yet. He said that he was Balthasar, an elderly man from Saba in Ethiopia, and his was the gift of a rare perfume, frankincense -- it was so fragrant that it seemed to flood all over his hands. After the introductions, Mother served the special cake. It was festive, and full of almonds, with a rich frosting and ornate decorations. “The person who gets the king token hidden in the cake, wears a special hat and is the king for tonight,” Mother said. “It’s the way that people in the old country remember the visit of the Three Kings to Bethlehem.” Well, the cake was sliced and I nearly broke a tooth on the token. “You get the hat,” Dad said, and everyone clapped toward to me. It was interesting, I’ll admit, but still, I wasn’t very happy. I almost spoiled everything by my sniffling. The nearest of the Three Kings looked at me. “It’s my kitten, Melchoir. I really wanted a little kitten. I even saw her at the Humane Society. Where is she now!” Mother gave a sigh. “King Melchoir,” she said, “Laurie’s been asking for a kitten for weeks. We went to the Humane Society the last day they were open before Christmas. We all saw the kitten. It’s so pretty and playful.” When we got up from the table, Mother mentioned something about caroling, and my playing the piano. Then, just in the nick of time, I was rescued from that embarrassment when I heard a muffled meow coming from another room. Yes, I did! Dad smiled, “Well, Sarah, a promise is a promise. If you can figure out who brought the cat, and where she is, you can keep her!” We looked around the house. We went upstairs and downstairs, and into the recreation room. Then we heard the kitten crying again, very faintly. There was an open window, and it sounded like the kitten was outside. It made a lot of noise for such a little creature. Clearly it wanted to be at home, with me! Dad, Mother and I, Caspar and Balthasar put on boots and overcoats and went outside, while Melchoir kept on the covered porch. “I see some tracks,” I shouted. And I did. There was one set of huge overshoe tracks, and they led from our parking circle up to the outside garage door, just on the other side of the kitchen. “Funny,” said Dad. “There weren’t any tracks when I came home an hour ago! Guess I forgot to lock that outside door!” “How will you know it’s your cat?” Balthasar asked. “It’s a beautiful kitten. White with orange paws and rich thick fur. When we saw her at the Humane Society, Dad said she must be a Maine Coon Cat, at least partly.” Dad suddenly gasped for breath, and took out an inhaler. “It’s my asthma,” he said. “When I spend more than a few seconds in cold weather my asthma acts up, and really puts me out of commission. These inhalers are a lifesaver.” Then, Mother helped him back inside. We opened the garage door and there, in a new animal carrying case, we heard the kitten again. Dad kept the garage fairly warm, but the air was still crisp. Pumpkin, my new kitten, was just as beautiful as I remembered. “And I know who put her here, too,” I said. “So I get to keep my kitten after all. This is the nicest Christmas season I’ve ever had!”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • All three “Kings” have a clear benevolent motive – they want to help Sarah get the promised kitten.  \n   • Mother and Father have already refused the kitten once; Father is using the mystery as a test, not as a gift-giver. Their motive is therefore weak or absent.  \n\n2. Opportunity / Alibis  \n   • Father – Severe asthma keeps him from staying outside more than a few seconds. The kitten was placed in the garage only minutes before it was found (the tracks were fresh), so Father could not have stayed out long enough to leave the case, close the door, and return.  \n   • Mother – Preparing and serving cake; she was in full view of everyone until the Kings arrived and stayed inside afterward.  \n   • Melchoir – Arrived in thin, tasseled slippers that were still wet. He had no outer footwear capable of making the large overshoe prints leading to the garage.  \n   • Balthasar – Reeked of frankincense. The garage was warm enough that his powerful scent would have lingered on the carrying case or in the air, yet there was no perfume smell there.  \n   • Caspar – A large, athletic man wearing big overshoes. He had several minutes between coming up the drive and knocking on the door; he could easily have stopped at the garage first, left the kitten, and then walked to the front porch with the others. His overshoes match the single trail of huge prints found in the snow.\n\n3. Physical evidence  \n   • Only one set of footprints: large overshoe prints that start at the parking circle and end at the garage door.  \n   • No frankincense odor in the garage (excludes Balthasar).  \n   • No small or medium-sized prints (excludes Mother and Father).  \n   • Slippers on Melchoir (excludes him).  \n   • Large, athletic build consistent with the “huge” prints (points to Caspar).\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   A single person walked from the driveway to the garage immediately before coming to the house. That person had to be big enough to make the prints, had to be wearing overshoes, and left no other distinguishing trace (like frankincense). Caspar is the only visitor who matches every requirement, so he is necessarily the one who placed the kitten.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCaspar of Tarsus, Melchoir of Persia, Balthasar of Saba, Sarah’s Father, Sarah’s Mother\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCaspar of Tarsus (alias “King Caspar”)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarlier that afternoon Father arranged with his three costumed friends to give Sarah a second chance at her Christmas wish. Caspar volunteered to collect the kitten from the Humane Society.\n\n1. Caspar drives up with the other two Kings.  \n2. Before they ring the front bell, Caspar, still in his huge overshoes, carries the crated kitten to the side garage door, sets the carrier inside, closes the door, and walks directly to the porch, leaving the only fresh track-way in the snow.  \n3. The three Kings enter, perform their dramatic visit, and sit down to cake.  \n4. During dessert the kitten meows; Father challenges Sarah to identify who brought it.  \n5. The search party follows the tracks; the kitten is found in the garage.  \n6. Sarah reasons through the clues—overshoe size, lack of frankincense, Melchoir’s slippers, Father’s asthma—and deduces that Caspar is the benefactor.  \n7. Mystery solved; Sarah earns her kitten.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Sarah’s Father – Physically unable to stay outdoors long enough; the footprints are far larger than his boots.  \n• Sarah’s Mother – Inside preparing and serving food, never out of sight; her ordinary shoes would not make huge prints.  \n• Melchoir of Persia – Wore only indoor slippers, which could not have produced the deep overshoe tracks.  \n• Balthasar of Saba – Hands and clothes saturated with frankincense that would have scented the garage; no such odor was present.\n\nOnly Caspar fits every fact; therefore he alone is the culprit—in the nicest possible sense.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
