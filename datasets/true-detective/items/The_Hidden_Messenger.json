      "content": "Zeb pulled his coat tight against the cold rain, and then saw the restaurant. It was two days before Christmas, Dec. 23, 1814. Lightning flashed over the Gulf of Mexico, revealing five enormous sails fluttering in the wind. Everyone knew the ships were there to attack. “Molly's,” read a large sign swinging in the rain. Zeb pushed open the door. He heard the townspeople of New Orleans gabbing excitedly while they ate. “I'm loading my shotgun!” “That'll scare the British away.” “We've captured hundreds of their ships.” “They burned Washington.” “ ‘We,’ ‘they’ – you’re all just men stuffing your fat faces,” Molly said, delivering a plate of hot sausage. There was laughter and shouts as the restaurant's hefty owner brought their meals, but not one familiar face, Zeb noted. “Maybe they're not British ships,” joked Marie, a small waitress. “Maybe Napoleon wants us back!” Eleven years earlier New Orleans belonged to the French, until their emperor sold the territory to President Thomas Jefferson as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Zeb searched the faces looking for the man who could help him, but Molly's small restaurant was filled only with the people of the town, their voices filled with excitement. Then the door opened, and in walked Ezekiel, his long scraggly hair still wet from the rain. He seemed just as anxious to get out of the cold. “Did you see the sails?” Ezekiel asked, looking worried. Zeb nodded. “General Jackson saw them too,” Ezekiel whispered. “But we have a problem.” Zeb scanned the faces in the restaurant. The British had already seized control of the shoreline ten miles south of New Orleans. The city's population was less than 40,000, and now foreign soldiers were preparing to invade. Andrew Jackson was preparing a defense. He had fortified his own troops with Choctaw Indians, pirates from Barataria Bay, 500 African-American soldiers and militias from Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Before the British could invade and to give his men time to prepare the defense, Jackson would send his troops to attack them. Tonight. “But the British will know he's coming.” Lightning struck outside. “How?” Zeb asked. “Someone just spotted the troop movements through the swamp, and is planning to meet the British commander here tonight. They're going to deliver the warning in a letter,” Ezekiel explained. “If the British receive it, Jackson's surprise attack will fail.” Zeb carefully scanned the crowd again. “What do they want with New Orleans?” Marie teased. “The Mississippi river!” yelled a burly sailor. “And everything west of it!” Someone in this restaurant had been sent ahead to warn the British. But who? “They ate President Madison's dinner!” “And burned his house!” “I heard Davy Crockett himself fought alongside General Jackson.” “What do we need Davy Crockett for when we've got your shot-gun?” Zeb and Ezekiel searched for suspects, and one face stood out in the crowd. The burly sailor sat across from a wealthy-looking man in a leather vest, wearing a wide, stylish hat. A pirate? Zeb and Ezekiel approached his table, and asked if they could join him for dinner. His name was Jean, and he readily agreed. “ ‘Tis too cold a night to deny you the warmth of my fine company,” Jean said grandly. Ezekiel asked casually what his line of business was. “I'm a privateer,” Jean said with a laugh. He reached slyly into his jacket pocket and pulled out a yellow parchment. “It’s signed by the U.S. Congress itself. I'm authorized to plunder the British ships!” He roared with laughter. “Don't you dare call him a pirate,” said Jean's companion, a sailor named Smith. “Marie, more rum!” shouted Jean. “Leave her alone!” shouted Molly protectively, pushing her thick spectacles back. “Marie's been working since noon.” Smith had arrived in Louisiana all the way from Maine, which would raise anyone's suspicion, since the New England states had threatened to secede. “Even if we are at war, money's money,” Smith said, patting down his wet hair. “There's money to be made in trading with Britain,” he added. “But me, I hate them. We beat them already, 36 years ago. Do we have to fight a second war of independence?” Molly delivered a warm plate to the sailor, piled high with slices of roast beef and steaming potatoes. Ezekiel leaned across the table and whispered a secret theory. “Maybe Molly is the British contact.” “They've already captured our gunboats,” Molly said to Smith with a laugh. “And it's so close to Christmas,” Smith joked back, drawing a big laugh from Jean the privateer. Molly leaned into the sailor's face, and said: “Standing so close to you, I can finally see your face, Mr. Smith. And it's an ugly one!” The sailor laughed loudly as Molly covered her spectacles in mock horror. Zeb and Ezekiel scanned the rest of the restaurant. It was getting late, and most of the other customers had left. One of the four people who remained was waiting for the British commander. “Read my letter from the U.S. Congress!” Jean said with a laugh. “It entitles me to plunder the British ships – and I don't even know how to read!” New Orleans would fall to the British unless Zeb and Ezekiel could identify their contact. Suddenly, the door swung open. A white-haired gentleman with a long, sharp nose had entered the restaurant, surveying the crowd and calling out for a meal. He said he was in a hurry. Ezekiel walked Zeb towards the door, then whispered: “Don't worry. I know who's delivering the warning letter to the British.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Means & Motive  \n•  Whoever warned the British had first-hand knowledge of Jackson’s hidden march through the swamp and was willing to profit by betraying it.  \n•  Only one diner actually says he values “money” more than loyalty and that “there's money to be made in trading with Britain” – the sailor who gives his name only as “Smith”. New England (his home, Maine) contained many merchants who openly opposed the war and carried on contraband trade with Britain, so the motive fits him perfectly.  \n\n2. Opportunity  \n•  The spy had to be out in the swamp after Jackson’s men moved and still reach the inn in time for the rendez-vous.  \n•  Marie was working “since noon”, Molly never left the restaurant, Jean was drinking there long before Zeb arrived, and he cannot read or write.  \n•  Smith, however, enters soaked, still dripping rain-water, which places him outdoors very recently. He alone had the opportunity to have seen the troops and to have written the warning on the ride back.  \n\n3. Physical evidence  \n•  Smith’s hair is “still wet from the rain” even though the other patrons have long since dried.  \n•  When Ezekiel quietly picks Smith’s pocket he comes up with a freshly written warning addressed to the British commander – the smoking-gun document.  \n•  Ezekiel reseals Smith’s own wax seal on the substitute letter, showing the original came from Smith’s pocket, not someone else’s.  \n\n4. Alibis eliminated  \n•  Marie: on duty all afternoon, witnessed by Molly.  \n•  Molly: poor eyesight (“those spectacles”) makes it nearly impossible to recognize troop movements at night and in heavy rain.  \n•  Jean: cannot even read, let alone compose a military report; also has a congressional privateering commission against Britain, making him an unlikely traitor.  \nHence, by exclusion and by direct possession of the warning letter, Smith must be the spy.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMolly (restaurant owner), Marie (waitress), Jean (privateer), Mr. Smith (sailor from Maine)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMr. Smith (alias “Smith”, a sailor from Maine)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate on 23 December 1814, British sympathiser “Smith” slipped through the swamp south of New Orleans, spotted General Andrew Jackson’s troops moving into position for their night attack, and hurriedly wrote a warning letter to the British commander.  \nSoaked by the storm, he reached Molly’s restaurant, the pre-arranged meeting point, still dripping rain-water. Posing as a harmless northern seaman, he ate and waited to hand over the note.  \nZeb and Ezekiel, sent to uncover any spy, observed that only Smith had both the motive (profit from Britain) and the opportunity (had obviously just come from outdoors). Ezekiel brushed past him, lifted the letter, read enough to confirm the treachery, then replaced it with a counterfeit assuring the British that the Americans “suspected nothing.”  \nThe white-haired “gentleman” who entered a little later was in fact General Andrew Jackson checking the temper of the town. Smith never realised he was sitting in the same room as the man he was trying to betray.  \nWhen Smith finally delivered the substitute letter, the British were misled, Jackson’s night attack succeeded, and the coming Battle of New Orleans became an American victory.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nMolly – She never left the restaurant (verified by every patron) and her poor eyesight would have made recognising troops at distance impossible.  \nMarie – On duty “since noon,” so she could not have been out in the swamp; as a lifelong resident she had no incentive to see her own town fall.  \nJean – Holds an American letter of marque against Britain; furthermore he admits he is illiterate, eliminating him from writing any warning.  \nEach lacks both the opportunity and physical evidence that point squarely at Smith.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

So how could he write a warning letter to the British?”\n“It's Marie, the waitress,” Zeb suggested.\n“No, Molly said that Marie had been working here since noon. So she couldn't have spotted General Jackson's troops in the swamp. Besides, Marie's lived in this town since 1803. I doubt she'd want to see it invaded.\"\n“Maybe Molly herself saw those troops,” Zeb suggested.\n“With those spectacles and her bad eyesight? I doubt she could see anybody – especially on such a rainy day!”\nEzekiel looked quickly back at Smith. “But speaking of rain, did you notice there's one man here whose hair is still wet?”\n“Smith! The man who said ‘Money's money, even if we're at war!’”\n“I bet there's even more money in selling military secrets...”\nAlarmed, Zeb started to move towards the table, but Ezekiel stopped him, and they walked out into the night.\nThe rain had finally stopped, and once outside, Ezekiel pulled a sheet of paper from his jacket. Scribbled hastily across it was a warning about the coming American attack. “I stole it from Smith's pocket,” he said with a laugh.\n“Won't he notice it's missing?”\n“I replaced it with a letter saying the Americans didn't suspect a thing,” Ezekiel laughed. “Then I sealed it with the same wax stamp. He'll deliver the wrong message – without even knowing it!”\nI looked back and saw the white-haired gentleman leave the restaurant, strolling into the clear starlit night. What happened in the days to come would thrill the country, making legends of the men who planned it. As the people of New Orleans came together to help defend their town, the people of America would feel they'd proved themselves as a nation. It was history in the making, and would be remembered for centuries to come.\nZeb looked worriedly after the white-haired man with the long, sharp nose.\n“Shouldn't we try to intercept the commander?” Zeb asked.\n“Commander?” Ezekiel said, and he started to laugh. “That's Andrew Jackson!”"
