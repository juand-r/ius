      "content": "My brother swears it's true. \"The Wellingtons are wealthy. That's how I remembered it.\" And when he'd first showed up, their son was pushing a little girl into the pool. \"Was it deliberate?\" \"Oh, absolutely. She was shaking some water out of her ear, and Percy J. Wellington just rushed up behind her and shoved her over the edge.\" \"Why would he do that?\" \"Because he was a brat.\" Mr. Wellington wasn't there. He'd hired my brother, a detective, to provide security for the party that Mrs. Wellington was giving her seven-year-old stepson. But I couldn't believe Percy was as rotten as my brother claimed. \"This was the brattiest kid in the world -- literally,\" he said. \"That's what everyone called him.\" He opened a drawer in his desk and pulled out a copy of People magazine from four years ago. He flicked through its stories about celebrities like Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears until he'd found the story he was looking for, and showed me its headline. \"Percy J. Wellington: The Brattiest Kid in the World.\" Scanning the article, I started to believe. There was a picture of eight women clustered around the little boy, each one straining to smile. \"When his daddy's in Dallas,\" read the caption, \"his seven-year-old son has eight nannies.\" Each nanny looked tired. The only person who seemed happy was Percy J. Wellington himself, wearing a wild grin like he was planning to push them all into the pool. \"I watched him running around and around,\" my brother remembered thoughtfully, \"like it was a game, to see who he could torture today.\" My brother said it slowly, like he was trying to understand another mystery -- why Percy was the way that he was. \"They'd actually hired children to be guests at his party. Even the caterers were terrified of him -- a staff of ten people who had laid out every possible kind of dessert on a fancy long table. But no one could eat any of it until Percy gave them permission. When that sad little girl climbed out of the pool, she looked frustrated and angry -- as Percy taunted her and gobbled a big piece of cake. The girl's mother just looked away helplessly.\" \"Her mother didn't say anything?\" \"They were all terrified of displeasing Percy's stepmother, who looked like an evil queen in her fancy white dress. But she'd hired the poorest people she could find -- people who really needed the money.\" \"Who'd hired them?\" \"Mr. Wellington's secretary. She was young and blonde, and she actually looked a little like Jessica Simpson. That's how I remembered her name -- Jessica -- and I just assumed that Mrs. Wellington, the queen of the castle, was insanely jealous of her.\" \"I bet,\" I said, fascinated by all the crazy people in the rich family. \"And it got even crazier when Percy disappeared.\" I was astonished, and my brother looked deeply embarrassed. \"While I stared at the little girl's mother, one of the nannies began arguing with Mrs. Wellington. With eight nannies, there was no one nanny who was in charge of discipline, but this particular nanny was very upset.\" \"Angelita, I paid for these guests,\" Mrs. Wellington had said, genuinely confused. \"A little boy needs discipline,\" the nanny argued. \"Or he'll grow up to be rotten.\" And that's when they heard the screams. \"It was Jessica,\" my brother said, \"screaming and screaming like the star in a horror movie.\" Percy was missing, and no one could find him. Jessica had turned her back for exactly five seconds, she'd said, but Percy was gone -- and then she'd felt helpless, and started to scream. Even after we searched the whole pool area, we couldn't find him.\" \"So where was he?\" I asked. There had been a private forest that surrounded the Wellington mansion, with a little path that ran back towards a guest cottage by their lake. My brother reasoned Percy couldn't have gone towards the mansion without somebody seeing him -- so he investigated the path. He spotted his first clue -- Percy's half-eaten piece of cake. \"The path only went in one direction, so I followed it to their guest cottage. Stacked outside was a pyramid of gifts – beautifully wrapped presents piled high into an impressive tower, with a gold rectangular box on the top. Mrs. Wellington wanted to surprise Percy, so that morning she'd secretly created the 'present pyramid' on the cottage's porch. No one else had known where they were -- but of course, if Percy guessed where his presents were hidden, he'd run off to explore them. \"Sure enough, Percy was there -- his face smeared with cake frosting. He refused to go back to the party. I told him his eight nannies were all worried, and he said 'Good!' I told him Jessica was even screaming, and he laughed and said he hated her. Finally I invented the perfect reason for him to rejoin his hired guests. \"I think someone's stealing your desserts.\" Percy ran down the path back to the pool screaming. A throng of happy nannies had crowded around him... Jessica squealed with joy and spent the next half hour on her phone explaining to Mr. Wellington that his son wasn't missing after all. But not a single one of the other children had smiled. Percy wanted to make sure none of them had eaten his desserts -- so he ran to the table and began gobbling them all down himself. He dug his fingers into the pie, grabbed jello with his other hand, scooped cookies up with his sticky right hand and brownies with his left. \"Stop it!\" screamed Angelita. \"Food is for sharing! Besides, you can't eat all that yourself.\" With a mouth full of blueberry pie, Percy mumbled back, \"I can too!\" And that's when the robbery occurred. \"That was the toughest part of the case,\" my brother said. \"Because when I asked the nannies who hated Percy enough to rob him, they said 'Everybody.'\" \"All eight of them said it -- at the exact same time.\" Percy was wired from all the sugar he'd just eaten, and he'd run around continuously for almost half an hour, my brother remembered. Angelita tried to distract him by saying there were still gifts for him at the guest cottage -- and Percy ran back down the path, crazy from the sugar and now frightened someone might steal his presents. But strangely enough, he was half right. All of the presents were there -- except for the most valuable one. \"His X-Box had been smashed to bits on the ground. Not just any X-Box, this one was gold-plated.\" \"Oh, come on.\" \"His father had taken it out of its original plastic case, then had a jeweler hand-craft it. It's in the article. I looked down, and read the People magazine article. \"Vincent Wellington even commissioned a Greenwich-based artist to create a customized case for young Percy's game console, replacing its ordinary plastic with pure, 14-caret gold.\" I checked the cover to make sure this was a real copy of People magazine... \"We didn't realize it at the time,\" my brother said, \"because Percy was busy ripping through all the wrapping paper on the presents. But Mrs. Wellington called me over and asked what had happened to the X-Box. With all the gold, it was worth thousands of dollars -- and it was supposed to be on top of the pyramid of presents. But it wasn't. \"I'd seen it there the first time I hunted down Percy, so I began looking around. I found it inside the guest cottage, a pile of smashed pieces from the game computer's circuitry. \"And the prime suspect was standing next to it.\" \"Who was it?\" \"The little girl Percy pushed into the pool.\" The cottage had been locked, but there was a window in the back that was left open for ventilation. It was four feet off the ground, but the little girl had done a chin-up on the sill, and then climbed inside to see what all those gold pieces were doing on the floor. \"Emily, are you telling me the truth,\" my brother had asked her gently. And Emily nodded her head emphatically up and down -- which is what he'd expect her to do, whether she was telling the truth or not. \"I was terrified of what Percy might do -- an out-of-control boy, wired up on sugar, staring at the pieces of a shiny gold present. Percy's temper was like a ticking time bomb waiting to go off, so I began looking for clues.\" The window's frame had a bolt so the window couldn't have been opened any higher, and no adult could've crawled inside. There was just one set of footprints leading to the window -- little Emily's -- so my brother ruled out the other children. But three people had keys to the cottage. One was Angelita, the nanny who'd wanted Percy to be disciplined. Had she grabbed the shiniest present and smashed it as a message for his mother? Mrs. Wellington seemed to think so, though she also blamed her husband's secretary, Jessica. \"Because Jessica was blonde, and Mrs. Wellington was jealous?\" \"She probably was. But Percy really hated Jessica and was always playing mean tricks on her. Once, he squirted a bottle of maple syrup into her hair. Jessica was furious -- she screams easily. So she definitely had a motive for revenge.\" My brother sighed patiently, like he wished some good will could've found the family. \"And Percy was a suspect too,\" he said. \"He'd run off to the cottage first, and he could've smashed the X-Box himself -- just to make everyone feel sorry for him. He had his own key, and he was capable of anything. Maybe he was going to blame it on Jessica -- or the little girl.\" My brother searched frantically for clues, but there weren't any. The cottage was seldom used, so it was still perfectly tidy from the last time it had been cleaned. The doorknob was shiny and spotless, and there was no furniture inside -- just a big empty room with a smashed X-Box on the floor. My brother sighed as he told the story now. \"They had all that money, but they were all so crazy.\" \"But at least I figured out who smashed the X-Box.\"",

          "reveal_text": "\"Who did it?\" I asked. \"Was it Percy, the brattiest kid in the world?\"\n\"It couldn't be Percy,\" my brother said with a smile. \"His fingers were covered with pie and jello -- and there was no time to wash up with all his running around. If he'd touched the doorknob in the room with the X-Box, there would've been some kind of mark.

Mrs. Wellington even forgave her, and in the end all of Angelita's scolding finally paid off.\n\"Percy finally decided to be nicer to his guests -- and let everyone have some dessert.\"",

          "prompt": "System: You are an ingenious and clever detective who will examine all the clues and reason through all the evidence to solve the crime.\n\nUser: Here is a detective puzzle. Please read the story carefully before you decide who the culprit is.\n\n\nMy brother swears it's true. \"The Wellingtons are wealthy. That's how I remembered it.\" And when he'd first showed up, their son was pushing a little girl into the pool. \"Was it deliberate?\" \"Oh, absolutely. She was shaking some water out of her ear, and Percy J. Wellington just rushed up behind her and shoved her over the edge.\" \"Why would he do that?\" \"Because he was a brat.\" Mr. Wellington wasn't there. He'd hired my brother, a detective, to provide security for the party that Mrs. Wellington was giving her seven-year-old stepson. But I couldn't believe Percy was as rotten as my brother claimed. \"This was the brattiest kid in the world -- literally,\" he said. \"That's what everyone called him.\" He opened a drawer in his desk and pulled out a copy of People magazine from four years ago. He flicked through its stories about celebrities like Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears until he'd found the story he was looking for, and showed me its headline. \"Percy J. Wellington: The Brattiest Kid in the World.\" Scanning the article, I started to believe. There was a picture of eight women clustered around the little boy, each one straining to smile. \"When his daddy's in Dallas,\" read the caption, \"his seven-year-old son has eight nannies.\" Each nanny looked tired. The only person who seemed happy was Percy J. Wellington himself, wearing a wild grin like he was planning to push them all into the pool. \"I watched him running around and around,\" my brother remembered thoughtfully, \"like it was a game, to see who he could torture today.\" My brother said it slowly, like he was trying to understand another mystery -- why Percy was the way that he was. \"They'd actually hired children to be guests at his party. Even the caterers were terrified of him -- a staff of ten people who had laid out every possible kind of dessert on a fancy long table. But no one could eat any of it until Percy gave them permission. When that sad little girl climbed out of the pool, she looked frustrated and angry -- as Percy taunted her and gobbled a big piece of cake. The girl's mother just looked away helplessly.\" \"Her mother didn't say anything?\" \"They were all terrified of displeasing Percy's stepmother, who looked like an evil queen in her fancy white dress. But she'd hired the poorest people she could find -- people who really needed the money.\" \"Who'd hired them?\" \"Mr. Wellington's secretary. She was young and blonde, and she actually looked a little like Jessica Simpson. That's how I remembered her name -- Jessica -- and I just assumed that Mrs. Wellington, the queen of the castle, was insanely jealous of her.\" \"I bet,\" I said, fascinated by all the crazy people in the rich family. \"And it got even crazier when Percy disappeared.\" I was astonished, and my brother looked deeply embarrassed. \"While I stared at the little girl's mother, one of the nannies began arguing with Mrs. Wellington. With eight nannies, there was no one nanny who was in charge of discipline, but this particular nanny was very upset.\" \"Angelita, I paid for these guests,\" Mrs. Wellington had said, genuinely confused. \"A little boy needs discipline,\" the nanny argued. \"Or he'll grow up to be rotten.\" And that's when they heard the screams. \"It was Jessica,\" my brother said, \"screaming and screaming like the star in a horror movie.\" Percy was missing, and no one could find him. Jessica had turned her back for exactly five seconds, she'd said, but Percy was gone -- and then she'd felt helpless, and started to scream. Even after we searched the whole pool area, we couldn't find him.\" \"So where was he?\" I asked. There had been a private forest that surrounded the Wellington mansion, with a little path that ran back towards a guest cottage by their lake. My brother reasoned Percy couldn't have gone towards the mansion without somebody seeing him -- so he investigated the path. He spotted his first clue -- Percy's half-eaten piece of cake. \"The path only went in one direction, so I followed it to their guest cottage. Stacked outside was a pyramid of gifts – beautifully wrapped presents piled high into an impressive tower, with a gold rectangular box on the top. Mrs. Wellington wanted to surprise Percy, so that morning she'd secretly created the 'present pyramid' on the cottage's porch. No one else had known where they were -- but of course, if Percy guessed where his presents were hidden, he'd run off to explore them. \"Sure enough, Percy was there -- his face smeared with cake frosting. He refused to go back to the party. I told him his eight nannies were all worried, and he said 'Good!' I told him Jessica was even screaming, and he laughed and said he hated her. Finally I invented the perfect reason for him to rejoin his hired guests. \"I think someone's stealing your desserts.\" Percy ran down the path back to the pool screaming. A throng of happy nannies had crowded around him... Jessica squealed with joy and spent the next half hour on her phone explaining to Mr. Wellington that his son wasn't missing after all. But not a single one of the other children had smiled. Percy wanted to make sure none of them had eaten his desserts -- so he ran to the table and began gobbling them all down himself. He dug his fingers into the pie, grabbed jello with his other hand, scooped cookies up with his sticky right hand and brownies with his left. \"Stop it!\" screamed Angelita. \"Food is for sharing! Besides, you can't eat all that yourself.\" With a mouth full of blueberry pie, Percy mumbled back, \"I can too!\" And that's when the robbery occurred. \"That was the toughest part of the case,\" my brother said. \"Because when I asked the nannies who hated Percy enough to rob him, they said 'Everybody.'\" \"All eight of them said it -- at the exact same time.\" Percy was wired from all the sugar he'd just eaten, and he'd run around continuously for almost half an hour, my brother remembered. Angelita tried to distract him by saying there were still gifts for him at the guest cottage -- and Percy ran back down the path, crazy from the sugar and now frightened someone might steal his presents. But strangely enough, he was half right. All of the presents were there -- except for the most valuable one. \"His X-Box had been smashed to bits on the ground. Not just any X-Box, this one was gold-plated.\" \"Oh, come on.\" \"His father had taken it out of its original plastic case, then had a jeweler hand-craft it. It's in the article. I looked down, and read the People magazine article. \"Vincent Wellington even commissioned a Greenwich-based artist to create a customized case for young Percy's game console, replacing its ordinary plastic with pure, 14-caret gold.\" I checked the cover to make sure this was a real copy of People magazine... \"We didn't realize it at the time,\" my brother said, \"because Percy was busy ripping through all the wrapping paper on the presents. But Mrs. Wellington called me over and asked what had happened to the X-Box. With all the gold, it was worth thousands of dollars -- and it was supposed to be on top of the pyramid of presents. But it wasn't. \"I'd seen it there the first time I hunted down Percy, so I began looking around. I found it inside the guest cottage, a pile of smashed pieces from the game computer's circuitry. \"And the prime suspect was standing next to it.\" \"Who was it?\" \"The little girl Percy pushed into the pool.\" The cottage had been locked, but there was a window in the back that was left open for ventilation. It was four feet off the ground, but the little girl had done a chin-up on the sill, and then climbed inside to see what all those gold pieces were doing on the floor. \"Emily, are you telling me the truth,\" my brother had asked her gently. And Emily nodded her head emphatically up and down -- which is what he'd expect her to do, whether she was telling the truth or not. \"I was terrified of what Percy might do -- an out-of-control boy, wired up on sugar, staring at the pieces of a shiny gold present. Percy's temper was like a ticking time bomb waiting to go off, so I began looking for clues.\" The window's frame had a bolt so the window couldn't have been opened any higher, and no adult could've crawled inside. There was just one set of footprints leading to the window -- little Emily's -- so my brother ruled out the other children. But three people had keys to the cottage. One was Angelita, the nanny who'd wanted Percy to be disciplined. Had she grabbed the shiniest present and smashed it as a message for his mother? Mrs. Wellington seemed to think so, though she also blamed her husband's secretary, Jessica. \"Because Jessica was blonde, and Mrs. Wellington was jealous?\" \"She probably was. But Percy really hated Jessica and was always playing mean tricks on her. Once, he squirted a bottle of maple syrup into her hair. Jessica was furious -- she screams easily. So she definitely had a motive for revenge.\" My brother sighed patiently, like he wished some good will could've found the family. \"And Percy was a suspect too,\" he said. \"He'd run off to the cottage first, and he could've smashed the X-Box himself -- just to make everyone feel sorry for him. He had his own key, and he was capable of anything. Maybe he was going to blame it on Jessica -- or the little girl.\" My brother searched frantically for clues, but there weren't any. The cottage was seldom used, so it was still perfectly tidy from the last time it had been cleaned. The doorknob was shiny and spotless, and there was no furniture inside -- just a big empty room with a smashed X-Box on the floor. My brother sighed as he told the story now. \"They had all that money, but they were all so crazy.\" \"But at least I figured out who smashed the X-Box.\"\n\"Who did it?\" I asked. \"Was it Percy, the brattiest kid in the world?\"\n\"It couldn't be Percy,\" my brother said with a smile. \"His fingers were covered with pie and jello -- and there was no time to wash up with all his running around. If he'd touched the doorknob in the room with the X-Box, there would've been some kind of mark. But instead, the doorknob was shiny and spotless.\"\n\"Maybe no one used the door,\" I said. \"Maybe the little girl, Emily, climbed in through the window.\"\n\"But she had to do a chin-up to even get in,\" my brother pointed out. \"And she couldn't do a chin-up if she was lugging around an X-Box -- especially one that was covered with heavy solid gold!\"\n\"Well, if I were that kid's secretary, I guess I'd have a reason to hate him.\"\nMy brother laughed, and said he felt sorry for Jessica. \"But she's spent that whole half hour on the phone with Mr. Wellington.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Clarify the crime  \n   • A solid-gold–cased X-Box, placed on the top of a “present pyramid” on the porch of the guest cottage, was carried inside the cottage and smashed to pieces.  \n   • Whoever did it had to unlock the cottage door (the window was too small/high for an adult to crawl through with a heavy console and it could not be raised further because of the bolt).  \n   • After the smashing the culprit left the room exactly as found: a perfectly clean, polished doorknob and an otherwise spotless interior.\n\n2. List everyone who might plausibly have done it  \n   a) Percy J. Wellington – the bratty birthday boy  \n   b) Angelita – one of the eight nannies, the only one openly demanding discipline for Percy  \n   c) Jessica – Mr. Wellington’s secretary, on the scene as party organiser  \n   d) Mrs. Wellington – step-mother and hostess  \n   e) Emily – the little girl Percy had pushed into the pool  \n   f) “All the other nannies / guests” – mentioned but with no keys or reason to approach the cottage  \n\n3. Check motive  \n   • Percy – could stage a “poor-me” drama or punish Jessica, but he adores presents; destroying his most valuable gift is completely against character.  \n   • Angelita – explicit motive: “A little boy needs discipline or he’ll grow up rotten.” Smashing the gift teaches both Percy and his indulgent step-mother a lesson.  \n   • Jessica – hates being tormented by Percy (syrup incident) and might resent Mrs. Wellington, so revenge is conceivable.  \n   • Mrs. Wellington – no clear motive to destroy the spectacular gift she herself arranged and hid.  \n   • Emily – no motive; she only wanted to see what shiny thing was lying on the floor.\n\n4. Check opportunity / alibi  \n   • Key-holders: Percy, Angelita, Jessica. (Mrs. Wellington specifically is NOT listed as owning a key.)  \n   • Window: only Emily’s small footprints are under it; no adult prints, so no adult entered that way.  \n   • Door: must have been used. Whoever opened it left no sticky or dirty prints – the knob remained shiny.  \n   • Timing:  \n       – From the instant Percy reached the dessert table until he was lured back to the cottage by Angelita’s remark was the only interval when everyone’s location is known.  \n       – During that half-hour Jessica is seen continuously on the phone to Mr. Wellington.  \n       – Percy’s hands were literally coated with pie, jello, cookies, etc. the whole time. He never left the party zone until Angelita sent him running to the presents.  \n       – Angelita had no assigned task during that same half-hour and could easily slip away for five minutes, unlock the cottage, carry the boxed console inside, smash it, relock, wipe the knob (she is a nanny – wet-wipes are always handy), return to the pool, and then “innocently” dangle the information about hidden gifts in front of Percy.\n\n5. Crucial logical clue  \n   Angelita “incriminated herself by even knowing the presents were there.” Mrs. Wellington had told no one where she had hidden them. The only way Angelita could know their location was by already having been to the cottage – exactly where and when the X-Box was destroyed.\n\n6. Eliminate the rest  \n   • Percy: sticky fingerprints would have appeared on the doorknob – none did.  \n   • Jessica: continuous telephone alibi.  \n   • Mrs. Wellington: lacks a key, never left the party area.  \n   • Emily: too small to haul a heavy, gold-plated console and had to pull herself in through the window after the crime was done.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nPercy J. Wellington, Angelita (nanny), Jessica (secretary), Mrs. Wellington (step-mother), Emily (little girl)\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nAngelita\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhile Percy was gobbling desserts and all eyes were on the commotion at the pool, Angelita quietly left the party area with her cottage key. She walked down the forest path, lifted the gold-plated X-Box from the top of the gift pyramid, unlocked the cottage door, stepped inside, and violently smashed the console on the bare floor. She then wiped the doorknob clean (explaining its spotless shine), stepped back out, locked the door, returned the short distance to the pool, and re-joined the other nannies. Minutes later she “helpfully” told Percy there were still presents waiting for him in the cottage, confident that his discovery of the wrecked console would cause an uproar and underline her belief that the boy needed firm discipline. Emily, curious about the glittering fragments she glimpsed through the window, performed a chin-up to crawl inside, where the detective found her. The smashed X-Box and Angelita’s unexplained knowledge of the hidden gifts exposed her as the culprit.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Percy J. Wellington – Could not have opened the cottage door without leaving sticky food residue on the pristine knob; never left the pool area until Angelita’s prompt.  \n• Jessica – Was on the telephone with Mr. Wellington for the entire relevant thirty-minute window, witnessed by multiple nannies.  \n• Mrs. Wellington – Did not possess a key to the cottage and never left the party area; destroying the lavish present she herself commissioned makes no sense for her.  \n• Emily – Entered through the half-open window only after the crime (single set of child-size footprints); physically incapable of hauling a heavy, gold-plated game console.  \nTherefore only Angelita had motive, opportunity, means, and incriminated herself by knowing the hidden-gift location.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n",
