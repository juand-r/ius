      "content": "The Christian Witness adult Sunday school class met every Sunday morning at 9:00 a.m. Class leader, Juliet Lowe, usually taught lessons from Biblical scripture. On this Sunday morning, there were only five members in attendance. This was neither surprising nor disturbing, as she had, through her many years as class leader, taught to as few as one person and as many as 20. The attendees this morning were all long time class members. Waylon Marsh, a retired school teacher, had attended the Christian Witness class for a little over 25 years, almost as long as Juliet. James and Judy Gant had been in class for 15 years, but had been members of their church for over 30 years. Ellie Wilson, a widow and oldest member of the group, was a charter member of Christian Witness, which was now in its 35th year. Doc Bentson was the newest member, having been with them for only 10 years. After an opening prayer, Juliet began her lesson. It came from the Gospel of Matthew 6:3-4, which states: “But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be done in secret; and your father who sees in secret will reward you.” Juliet also included Old Testament scripture concerning the practice of tithing, citing from Deuteronomy 14:22, “Set apart a tithe of all the yield of your seed that is brought in yearly from the field.” As Juliet concluded her lesson, she was pleased, for she had incorporated scripture from both the Old and New Testaments and the class had listened and discussed intently the important concepts of doing good works in secret and tithing 10% of what one earns to the work of the Lord. Unlike most other Sunday school classes, Christian Witness collected offerings after, not before, the main lesson. Another unwritten rule that Christian Witness observed was that every member would place one dollar in the offering envelope. Juliet was aware that the rest of the church considered the Christian Witness class to be somewhat idiosyncratic and these were a couple of the reasons why. (Another reason was that is was well known that Judy Gant had, for years, made a practice of keeping detailed notes during class and usually filled up several pages). Even so, Juliet liked the tradition of everyone donating a dollar. It kept the group’s modest budget predictable and allowed class members to practice Christian discipline. Juliet, placing her dollar into the envelope first, did not pay strict attention to the others as the envelope made its way around the table. Though, she did notice Doc place a dollar bill into the envelope. She noticed also that James Gant placed a dollar bill plus change into the envelope for his and Judy’s donation. Today’s offering would be $6.00 and push the class balance to almost $100.00 As Juliet emptied the envelope to confirm the morning’s giving, she noticed something odd. The total was $6.10, including five one-dollar bills, four quarters and one dime. At first, she could not figure out why there was an extra dime. She suspected that James accidentally placed it into the envelope with his change. When questioned, James responded, “The four quarters were the only coins in my pocket.” Juliet, a former agent of the state Bureau of Investigation, was puzzled. She quickly realized that someone in class had taken her lesson to heart. A 10% tithe on top of a regular offering had been made, and it had been done so in secret. She shared her revelation with the others. Everyone grinned. “So, Juliet, who paid the secret tithe?” asked Doc. Juliet replied, “I’m not sure. I need to ask a couple of questions.” Another rule of Christian Witness was that no falsehoods were ever spoken within the classroom walls. She knew she would hear the truth. First, she asked Judy, “Do you, or did you, have coins in your skirt pocket?” Judy answered, “No, and, even if I did, I had a pencil in my hand when the envelope was being passed around.” Turning to Ellie, she asked, “Ellie, do you have your handbag with you?” “Yes.” “May I see it?” Ellie arose from her seat and headed toward the classroom door. She brought her purse back over to the table. “This thing’s heavy and I’m getting old, so I just parked it by the door today,” she announced. She offered it to Juliet, who noticed that it was an old fashioned handbag, somewhat large and obviously full of various items. The snap top was clasped shut. “The only thing I had with me at the table was the dollar for the offering,” Ellie insisted. Juliet said nothing, but then asked Waylon Marsh, “May I see your wallet?” Waylon complied and removed the wallet from his back pocket. Juliet noticed that it was an expensive wallet, made of rich leather and containing various plastic windows to carry credit cards plus a zipper compartment for concealing large bills. Handing it back, she gave Waylon a compliment. “That’s a very nice wallet, Waylon.” She then asked, “Do you have coins in your pocket?” Waylon replied, “Yes, but only nickels and pennies.” Pausing for a moment, she continued, “I know who our secret tither is.”\n \n*Note: All scripture quoted comes from the New Revised Standard Version Bible.",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the “crime.”  \n   • The only unusual act is that someone slipped a single dime (10 ¢) into the class‐offering envelope in addition to the expected six one-dollar bills.  \n   • Therefore the “culprit” is simply the anonymous 10 % tither.\n\n2. List what is known about each person’s donation.  \n   • Juliet Lowe – placed her $1 bill first, never touched the envelope again.  \n   • Doc Bentson – clearly seen by Juliet to place one $1 bill only.  \n   • James Gant – seen to put in one $1 bill plus four quarters (he and his wife’s $2 total) and later states those four quarters were the only coins he carried.  \n   • Judy Gant – had a pencil in hand and no coins in her skirt pocket.  \n   • Ellie Wilson – brought only her single $1 bill to the table; her heavy handbag (where any coins would be) stayed by the door, out of her reach while the envelope circulated.  \n   • Waylon Marsh – put in his $1 bill; admits to having “only nickels and pennies” in his trouser pockets; possesses a wallet with a zippered coin compartment that could hold a dime.\n\n3. Check opportunity.  \n   • The envelope went round the small table once. Only the person actually passing it could have slipped in a coin unseen. Every member had that opportunity except Juliet (she was watched because she went first) and Doc (who was watched deliberately).  \n   • Physical proximity rules out Ellie: her bag (and any coins) was across the room.  \n   • Judy could not free a hand to add a coin while holding her pencil and notebook.  \n   • James’s change is fully accounted for (four 25-cent pieces).  \n   • Waylon both had a free hand and possessed a concealed source of coins (the zippered wallet).\n\n4. Examine contradictions and admissions.  \n   • The critical fact Juliet withholds from the group is the coin’s denomination. When Waylon volunteers that he carries “only nickels and pennies,” he implicitly claims knowledge that the mystery coin is a dime – knowledge he could not have unless he himself handled the dime.  \n   • No other statements conflict with the physical evidence.\n\n5. Motive.  \n   • Waylon is a retired schoolteacher, long-time, disciplined church member—just the sort who would enjoy acting on the morning’s lesson by quietly giving an exact 10 % tithe (one dime on a dollar).  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJuliet Lowe, Waylon Marsh, James Gant, Judy Gant, Ellie Wilson, Doc Bentson\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nWaylon Marsh\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhen the envelope reached him, Waylon Marsh slipped his customary one-dollar bill into it and, from the zippered coin compartment of his wallet, added a single dime—exactly a 10 % tithe on the dollar. He then passed the envelope on. Moments later, asked about coins, he tried to divert suspicion by claiming he had “only nickels and pennies” in his pockets, omitting the fact that his wallet held other coins. Because Juliet never disclosed the coin’s denomination, his unnecessary specification betrayed that he already knew it was a dime, confirming him as the secret tither.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Juliet Lowe—placed her dollar first in full view and did not regain possession of the envelope.  \n• Doc Bentson—observed by Juliet to insert exactly one dollar bill, nothing else.  \n• James Gant—accounted for every coin he possessed (four quarters); no dime was among them.  \n• Judy Gant—had a pencil in hand and no coins in her pocket, preventing her from adding the dime unnoticed.  \n• Ellie Wilson—her handbag, holding any coins, was across the room; she only brought the single dollar bill to the table.  \n\nThat leaves Waylon Marsh as the sole person with motive, means, opportunity, and inadvertent self-incrimination.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

I saw him place a dollar bill and, as he claims, four quarters, into the envelope. Plus you had a pencil in your hand during the offering. I also know it wasn’t Doc, because I saw him place his dollar into the envelope. I’m not the secret tither, so that leaves Ellie and Waylon.”\nJuliet looked at Ellie. “I knew you left your handbag at the door, but wanted to ask anyway in the name of sportsmanship. I knew you would have a dollar with you for the offering and knew whatever coins you have would be in the bag. You had no way of knowing what today’s lesson would be or that somebody would be playing a little game with us.”\nShe looked at Waylon and smiled, “Your good deed is not so secret anymore.”\nWaylon smiled back, “I guess not. How did you know?”\n“A wallet zipper compartment is an excellent place to hide money – bills and coins! I knew for certain it was you when you told me that you have only pennies and nickels in your pockets, as I never mentioned to you that it was a dime.”\nWaylon thought for a moment and sheepishly told the class, “Well, I tried to do a small good deed in secret.”\nJuliet smiled and reminded the class of the verses from Matthew they had discussed today. “Waylon gave alms in secret and our Father has rewarded him by making his good deed public. Praise the Lord! This is a good lesson to learn. There is nothing we can do -- good or bad -- that will stay secret forever. As we have seen, sometimes our secrets do not stay secret very long at all.”\nShe then repeated a favorite saying of the Christian Witness class: “God is good – all the time!”"
