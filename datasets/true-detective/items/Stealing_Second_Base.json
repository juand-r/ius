      "content": "The Westbrook High School gymnasium was decorated in WHS colors, green and gold. Volunteers spent most of the day hanging decorations and bringing in tables and chairs, while a kitchen crew prepared turkeys that would be served to hundreds of baseball fans at the upcoming dinner presentation. The rain that started in the late afternoon turned the parking lot into a mud bowl. But that didn’t dampen our spirits – not by a long shot. It was the first time in fifteen years that a Westbrook High School varsity team had won a state championship, a real thrill for one of the smallest schools in the state’s A League. That ranking was a remnant of the days when Westbrook itself had a much larger population. Over the years had come hard times, a factory closing, and families moving away to the further suburbs. But Westbrook High School had held on, with stubborn pride, to its A League ranking, competing against much larger high schools. Well, come to think of it, what other school in the state had received a personal visit from Derek Jeter, star shortstop of the New York Yankees? As generous with his time as he was gifted in the field, Jeter had hosted a baseball clinic at WHS last spring, as the baseball season began. Before he left, Jeter personally signed and dated a brand new second base bag, which was put in a locked display case to inspire the team. That spring, the Westbrook Black Sox – out of nowhere – had a winning season. Correct that – they had a spectacular season! They led the A League for the very first time. Coach Morgan claimed it wasn’t any of his doing. The Derek Jeter magic must have rubbed off on the team. And now, at tonight’s banquet, the high school sports commissioner would visit Westbrook for the first time. Students made jokes about it, “… Bet he needs a map to find us!” There were even rumors that Derek Jeter himself, who we all believed had kept tabs on our baseball team throughout the season, might come. But all of the excitement would end when Principal Carol Jackson came to me in distress. “Sam,” she said, “there’s been a robbery. I just can’t believe it. The display case! Mary Thornton just told me that our prize base is missing!” Why she was calling this to my attention, I can’t say. (Maybe it’s because I’m the very smart editor of our school newspaper, the Tribune?) Anyway, I followed where her bony finger was pointing, straight at the display case. The door was closed, and there was empty space where the autographed second base used to be. I felt sick. “Find out what’s going on, will you? People will be arriving in less than an hour.” I saw Coach Joe Morgan in his nearby office, his door wide open as usual, students going in and out. I gave him the news, adding that the principal told me to find out what had happened. “Glad you’re interested in sports, Sam. We could have used some support during our baseball season. The Tribune didn’t pay us much attention. Not that we needed it!” “Yes, sir.” I could see that he wasn’t going to be of much help. I remembered from Law and Order reruns that people often sounded like wise guys when they were facing an investigation. I’d find out what happened, and that would make a nice addition to my resumé when it came time to apply for admission to college next year. Sam Waters on the case! What would a Law and Order detective want to know? Of course … “Mr. Morgan, who had access to the display case during the cleanup this afternoon?” He thought for a minute, “There are just two sets of keys to the display cases. I have one set, and the principal keeps the other set. I gave my keys to Randy Newsom. He had some help cleaning the case this afternoon. Shorty Gilstrap was with him.” That made sense. Randy Newsom was the baseball team’s all-star captain, and Shorty, appropriately, played shortstop. They were an inseparable combination, on and off the field. I spoke with Randy first. “Sure, Coach Martin asked me and Shorty to clean the case.” “And ...” “We took everything out, the dusted the case. I thought it looked better, but it was just getting dirtier. Plus, Shorty had just come from Art 101, and I was worried that he would get paint on the windows, or on the trophies. … Not that we have many trophies.” “What happened then?” “Well, fortunately, Mary Thornton came by, proudly wearing her cheerleading uniform. She sure does look great in that uniform. It fits her perfectly …” “Randy. Focus! What happened with the display case?” “Oh, right. Well, Mary knew about cleaning stuff. She even had some Windex. We took everything out of the display case once again, and she sprayed the glass windows. Then she wiped them dry. ‘Put them back where you want them,’ she said. I did, and then she left. I had to run, so I gave the keys to Shorty.” “When did you notice that the second base was missing, Randy?” “I didn’t … it’s missing?” “So you put back everything in its place?” “Yes. I did. By the way, I was there most of the time. I only went to grab some Cokes. Then I had to go pick up my date for the banquet.” “Thanks, Randy. That helps a lot.” I sounded more confident than I actually felt. (Well, that’s how they sounded on Law and Order.) Next on my list of suspects: Shorty Gilstrap. “What’s up, dude?” he said. “I hear you were helping Randy clean the display case.” “For a minute or so. But I couldn’t stay long. I had to help bring in tables.” “Wait a second. Was the second base there when you left to see Coach Morgan?” “Absolutely, cross my heart -- and oh, yes, I returned the keys to Coach Morgan.” Next, I spotted Mary Thornton walking toward her locker, decked out in her cheerleading uniform, her sweater dangling below her waist, looking two sizes too big. “Hi Mary. Got a minute?” “Sure. What’s going on? Looking for a scoop for the Tribune?” “Something like that. Randy told me you were a big help in cleaning that display case.” “Somebody had to. Those two were totally hopeless. It seemed to be getting even dirtier, if you can imagine such a thing. Shorty’s nickname should be Pigpen!” “So everything was there when you left?” “I’m quite sure that everything was still there. Later, I did go back and take a second look. One of the trophies was just a bit off center. That annoyed me. I’d been working all day. Even had to take off my sweater, to keep it clean for the banquet. I got some keys from the principal, opened the door, moved the trophy, and then locked the case and returned the keys to her.” “Thanks, Mary. Now I know what happened to our famous souvenir.”",

          "reveal_text": "I saw Principal Carol Jackson going into the faculty room near the gymnasium door, and followed her into the room.\n“An interesting case,” I said. “By the way, nobody told a lie. But nobody quite told the whole story, either. The only three students with access to the open display case were Randy Newsom, Mary Thornton and Shorty Gilstrap.”\n“What about Coach Morgan?” she asked.\n“Coach Morgan’s office is in plain sight, so he couldn’t have taken the base. After the display case was cleaned, Randy had to leave, and Shorty returned the keys to Coach Morgan. Plus, Randy didn’t even know the base was missing. And Shorty barely touched anything because he had paint all over himself.”\n“It’s quite obvious then, yes?”\n“Yes. That leaves Mary. To her perfectionist eye, the boys probably had left a display off center, as she says. But that was just an excuse. She didn’t exactly say the base was missing when she got the keys from you. I think she got your keys, opened the case, adjusted the display, and wrapped the second base bag up in her sweater, which would explain why it now looks stretched, two sizes too big.”\nPrincipal Carol Jackson turned red, “Sam, Coach Morgan has something to tell us. He wanted it to be a surprise to me, too!”\n“This is why I wanted the display case cleaned,” Coach Morgan said. “And also why I asked Mary to “steal” the second base from the case for me. Both Randy and Shorty were out of the building when I needed them, and Mary happened to be right there.”\n“I don’t understand?” I said.\nThis was supposed to be a surprise – not a mystery. … There’s somebody you should meet.”\n“Hi kid,” came the cheerful, commanding voice of the shortstop of the New York Yankees. “Looks like it’ll be a great banquet, after a terrific baseball season. Coach Morgan asked me to write “A League Champions” on this second base bag, above my signature. Hope it makes a good story for your newspaper.”\n“Yes, sir,” I stammered. It really was quite a story -- both the one I would write, and the one I would now keep to myself!",

Now I know what happened to our famous souvenir.”\nI saw Principal Carol Jackson going into the faculty room near the gymnasium door, and followed her into the room.\n“An interesting case,” I said. “By the way, nobody told a lie. But nobody quite told the whole story, either. The only three students with access to the open display case were Randy Newsom, Mary Thornton and Shorty Gilstrap.”\n“What about Coach Morgan?” she asked.\n“Coach Morgan’s office is in plain sight, so he couldn’t have taken the base. After the display case was cleaned, Randy had to leave, and Shorty returned the keys to Coach Morgan. Plus, Randy didn’t even know the base was missing. And Shorty barely touched anything because he had paint all over himself.”\n“It’s quite obvious then, yes?”\n“Yes. That leaves Mary. To her perfectionist eye, the boys probably had left a display off center, as she says. But that was just an excuse. She didn’t exactly say the base was missing when she got the keys from you. I think she got your keys, opened the case, adjusted the display, and wrapped the second base bag up in her sweater, which would explain why it now looks stretched, two sizes too big.”\nPrincipal Carol Jackson turned red, “Sam, Coach Morgan has something to tell us. He wanted it to be a surprise to me, too!”\n“This is why I wanted the display case cleaned,” Coach Morgan said. “And also why I asked Mary to “steal” the second base from the case for me. Both Randy and Shorty were out of the building when I needed them, and Mary happened to be right there.”\n“I don’t understand?” I said.\nThis was supposed to be a surprise – not a mystery. … There’s somebody you should meet.”\n“Hi kid,” came the cheerful, commanding voice of the shortstop of the New York Yankees. “Looks like it’ll be a great banquet, after a terrific baseball season. Coach Morgan asked me to write “A League Champions” on this second base bag, above my signature. Hope it makes a good story for your newspaper.”\n“Yes, sir,” I stammered. It really was quite a story -- both the one I would write, and the one I would now keep to myself!\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive  \n   • Randy Newsom – none. As team captain he reveres the autographed bag; no gain in stealing it.  \n   • Shorty Gilstrap – same as Randy; no evident motive.  \n   • Mary Thornton – no sentimental attachment, but prides herself on “perfect” displays; yet that is not a motive to steal, only to straighten things.  \n   • Coach Joe Morgan – would like the base back temporarily so that Derek Jeter can add the words “A-League Champions” before the banquet.  \n   ⇒ Only Coach Morgan has a positive reason for the bag to disappear.\n\n2. Opportunity / Access  \n   • Two key sets exist. During the afternoon Randy and Shorty use Coach’s set; later Shorty returns that set to Morgan.  \n   • The principal lends her set to Mary when Mary says she wants to straighten a trophy.  \n   • Thus, after Shorty leaves and before anyone notices the loss, Mary is the only person who possesses a key and is standing at the open case.\n\n3. Physical evidence / alibis  \n   • Randy was away buying Cokes and then picking up his banquet date; he never even realised the base was missing.  \n   • Shorty was carrying wet paint on his clothes and claims he handled nothing; Sam sees the paint and Morgan confirms he got the keys back.  \n   • Mary’s cheer-leader sweater looks “two sizes too big” – perfect for hiding the flat, square base bag.  \n   • Mary admits she opened the case alone.  \n   • Coach Morgan’s office is visible at all times, so he could not have physically taken the base; but he could instruct someone else.\n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   • Only one person had motive (Coach Morgan) and only one person had the unsupervised access at the critical moment (Mary).  \n   • Coach needed the base removed; Mary removed it for him and hid it under her sweater.  \n   • Therefore Mary is the person who actually took the base, but she did so as an accomplice for Coach Morgan.  \n   • Because the puzzle asks for a single culprit and someone physically removed the base, that person is Mary Thornton.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nRandy Newsom, Shorty Gilstrap, Mary Thornton, Coach Joe Morgan\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMary Thornton\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nCoach Morgan wanted Derek Jeter, who would arrive just before the banquet, to add “A-League Champions” above his earlier autograph on the WHS second-base bag.  \nAfter Randy and Shorty finished cleaning, Shorty returned Coach’s keys. Morgan now needed the bag but both ballplayers were gone. Mary Thornton happened to be in front of the case complaining about a slightly off-center trophy. Morgan quietly asked her to take the base out for him, cautioning her to keep it secret so the surprise would not be ruined.  \nMary borrowed the principal’s key set under the pretext of straightening the trophy, opened the case, centred the trophy, slipped the base under her oversized cheer-leader sweater, locked the case again, and returned the keys.  \nShe carried the wrapped base to Coach Morgan, who walked it to a back room where Derek Jeter signed it on his arrival.  \nBecause no one had told Sam or the principal about the plan, it appeared to be a theft until the Coach and Jeter revealed the truth.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Randy Newsom – After replacing the items he left to buy drinks and then fetch his date; when told the bag was gone he was genuinely surprised. He never held a key again after he left.  \n• Shorty Gilstrap – Left early to move tables and, covered in wet paint, avoided touching the trophies; he returned the only key in his possession to Coach Morgan before the disappearance.  \n• Coach Joe Morgan – Conceived the plan but never laid hands on the display case; his office remained in full view, giving him no discreet chance to open it. He needed someone else to retrieve the base and chose Mary.  \nThus only Mary actually removed the object from the locked case, making her the sole “culprit” in the apparent robbery—even though she acted at the Coach’s request and the base was returned in time for the banquet.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
