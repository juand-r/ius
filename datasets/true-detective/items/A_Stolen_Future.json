      "content": "George Wilson slid his access card through the reader and entered the office. He walked past the rows of empty workstations and stopped at the desk of his assistant, Donna Blake. It was 6:30 in the morning and no one else had yet arrived. As was his routine, he asked for his messages and continued toward his office. Instead of entering his normal, tidy work area, he stumbled into a chaotic one where Mr. Wilson’s desk and chair were shoved up against the far wall with papers all over the floor. The safe was blown open and all its contents were missing; at least that’s the way George described it to me, Mike Murphy, the lead detective on the case. When I first arrived at the office suite, I phoned George’s assistant, Donna Blake, to gain access. There was a card reader at the main entrance that prevented unwanted visitors; a turnstile allowed only one person to enter with each card swipe. After her corporate office had remotely disabled the security system, Ms. Blake met me at the door and escorted me back to Mr. Wilson’s office. By the time I made it to the burgled safe, my team had already dusted for prints (none were found) and sent for a squad car to bring the company’s local IT manager in for questioning because he was the closest person the company had for a security expert. In the meantime, I sat down with George Wilson, the office manager. After he described what he found in the office this morning, I asked him to tell me what happened last night before the robbery. “Well, we had a big office party to celebrate the completion of our new computer chip. It represents a new technology that puts us miles ahead of the competition,” he explained. “Since it was just approved for production, I displayed the chip last night to our whole team, and we celebrated its pending release. We shut down just before midnight because I had to be in early today to prepare for a meeting.” He hesitated: “If our rivals get hold of that chip, we are sunk.” Mr. Wilson seemed to have genuine grievances, but I‘ve seen too many good actors in my day to prematurely bank on his honesty. The last time he saw the chip, he explained, was when he put it back in the safe at midnight; moreover, it was right after the party, and in front of several different witnesses who knew he had an early and busy day ahead of him. I next interviewed Ms. Blake, George’s assistant. She seemed friendly enough, but looked very tired. She told me that she had left with everyone else last night, and had returned around 6:00 a.m. to prepare several reports for Mr. Wilson’s teleconference, which was scheduled for this afternoon. She showed me the reports; the bags under her eyes coincided with the stack of papers she juggled in her arms. “I didn’t have time to go into his office today,” she said. “I had to fix a bunch of mistakes. My lack of sleep must be affecting my concentration because I keep putting tomorrow’s date on all his reports. Maybe I subconsciously want this day to end already,” she sarcastically huffed. “I don’t know why they aren’t automatically dated like they usually are. I suppose it’s some computer glitch.” “Who else has been in the office since the party last night?” “Only Mr. Wilson, me and ... the night janitor,” she recounted. “Someone had to clean up the mess we made with our celebration.” I asked an officer to go round up the janitor, a Mr. Pete Thompson. Next I talked to Jeffery Sharp, the computer tech. According to Donna Blake, he’s in charge of the office’s computer system. He looked just as tired as Ms. Blake; apparently, Jeffery had been working overtime lately, trying to wrap up the computer maintenance before he went on a two-week vacation, which started today. Mr. Sharp seemed agitated from the start: “Look, I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but my plane leaves in less than three hours,” he spat. “And I was up all night packing.” “I’ll do my best to get you there on time.” I replied with as much diplomacy as I could muster. “Where is it that you’re headed?” “Aruba.” He answered. “With beautiful beaches, and, best of all, no computers!” “Can you can get me a printout of everyone that has been in this office since the party last night?” I asked. Without answering, he led me over to his workstation, wiped the sleep from his eyes, and began to type. Soon he handed me a printout of a very short list; it showed that only two people had entered the office that morning: Ms. Blake at 6:10 and Mr. Wilson at 6:25. “You can see I wasn’t here after the party. “Send me on my way,” he pleaded. “Let’s get all the facts, and then you can go. Stick around for a bit and we’ll wrap this up.” I said as I exited to question the last suspect. Pete Thompson, the janitor, puzzled me the most, especially because there was no record of him using the access card last night. He said he had come in at 1:00 a.m. to clean up after the party, and that he had left around 4:00 a.m. for his next shift at another location, which ended at 5:30 a.m. He had just gone to bed when the officer arrived to get him. A quick call to Pete’s second job confirmed that he had indeed arrived there at 4:00 this morning. And, from the disheveled description of the office, three hours seemed to be an appropriate estimate of time it would take to clean up. On top of that, I figure it would take at least an hour to break in to the safe. Where would Pete have found the time? I decided to make a call to the chip manufacturer’s corporate offices. Mr. Connelly, the head of security, could not explain how the janitor had entered the building without using his card. If there had been a system malfunction, he assured me that the system would simply shut down all access. I also asked him if someone in Jeffery’s position would be able to tamper with the system. Mr. Connelly said that very limited access is granted to an employee in Jeffery’s position; however, he could adjust the system to synchronize with events like daylight savings and leap years because the company’s security system is directly linked to the rest of their computer system. Jeffery couldn’t have shut the system off without also shutting off all entry — or exit. When I returned to the crime scene, I saw Jeffery complaining that he now only had two hours to make his flight. He waved his tickets around and threw them down on top of the “office access” printout he had given me earlier. I looked at his tickets and the printout again. I told Jeffery he should first meet me in the conference room — before he took to Aruba — so I could explain to him what had happened to the computer chip.",

She also said that, just like on her morning reports, the dates were wrong: The one with Pete and Jeffery was dated today, and the one with her and Mr. Wilson was actually dated tomorrow.\nI explained that, since the security system would shut down office access if anyone local tried to turn it off, the thief had to find another way around it. Jeffery Sharp had been granted access to one small, but important, part of the security system: When he changes the date in the office’s computer system, it also changes it in the security system. So to hide his theft, the night he cracked the safe, he moved the date forward one day the night. He obviously hoped that no one would notice until he was safely out of the country.\nFor me, it all came together when I saw that the date on Jeffery’s tickets didn’t match the date on the access report for the day of the robbery.",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Motive\n   •  George Wilson – none that make sense; the chip is his responsibility and the loss ruins his big meeting.  \n   •  Donna Blake – no obvious gain; she is over–worked and preparing the very reports that will be useless if the chip is gone.  \n   •  Pete Thompson – a night-janitor who would have to find a buyer for an ultra-high-tech prototype; unlikely.  \n   •  Jeffery Sharp – an over-tired employee who is about to disappear to Aruba for two weeks with cash easily concealed.  If a rival has offered him money, this is the perfect moment to leave the country.\n\n2.  Opportunity\n   •  The only people known to be in the building between the party and 6-00 a.m. are Pete (1:00-4:00) and Jeffery (4:15- ?).  \n   •  Breaking the safe and clearing the office clearly took longer than the few minutes Wilson and Blake were there in the morning, so the burglary had to occur during Pete’s or Jeffery’s time-window.  \n   •  Only Jeffery possesses the computer rights needed to change the date in the integrated computer / security system – a key fact supplied by corporate security chief Mr. Connelly.\n\n3.  Physical evidence / alibis\n   •  Pete’s second employer confirms he arrived there at 4:00 a.m.; after that he is visible to others until 5:30 a.m. – too late to spend an hour blowing a safe in Wilson’s office.  \n   •  The access log that Jeffery himself printed shows Blake at 6:10 and Wilson at 6:25, with TODAY’S date shown as “tomorrow.”  \n   •  A second log (the one Donna prints) shows only two entries, Pete 1:07 and Jeffery 4:15, and is incorrectly dated “today.”  \n   •  Jeffery’s airline tickets are dated with the real calendar date, not the one the computer system is now using – proving the system date has been shifted.\n\n4.  Logical deduction\n   •  If the date had not been altered, Blake and Wilson’s early-morning entries would have appeared on the same page as Pete and Jeffery’s – yet they do not.  \n   •  The only person able to move the date forward one day without bringing the whole security system down is Jeffery.  \n   •  Moving the date one day forward at about 4:20 a.m. would cause every later entry (Blake and Wilson) to be stamped with “tomorrow,” leaving the true day of the crime apparently blank – exactly what the detective sees.  \n   •  Therefore, the person in the building with both the required access to the computer clock and the free hour needed to blast the safe is Jeffery Sharp.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGeorge Wilson, Donna Blake, Pete Thompson, Jeffery Sharp\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJeffery Sharp\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n23:50 Party ends. 23:59 George Wilson locks the prototype chip in the office safe.\n\n00:00–01:00  (new day)  No one in the office.\n\n01:07   Janitor Pete Thompson swipes in, spends three hours cleaning after the party, and leaves at 04:00 to reach his second job by 04:30.\n\n04:15   IT technician Jeffery Sharp uses his access card, enters the office suite and heads straight for his workstation.\n\n04:18   Jeffery changes the network date-time one full day ahead.  From this moment the security system believes it is “tomorrow.”\n\n04:20–05:20   Wearing gloves, Jeffery forces the safe, removes the prototype chip and any incriminating contents, knocks Wilson’s furniture around to suggest an outside burglary, and wipes obvious prints.\n\n05:25   Jeffery leaves the building.  The security log records neither his exit nor any other activity because the time/date function he tampered with is in flux until the next swipe.\n\n06:10   Assistant Donna Blake arrives; her entry is now stamped with the false (“tomorrow’s”) date.\n\n06:25   George Wilson arrives; his entry too is stamped “tomorrow.”\n\n08:00   Detective Murphy questions the staff.  Jeffery prints out the current-day report (which the system labels as tomorrow); it shows only Blake and Wilson.  He hopes the “real” day’s report (now dated today) will never be examined until he is sunning himself in Aruba.\n\n09:00   Donna prints the preceding day’s report – it contains only Pete and Jeffery, and is dated today, exposing the date-shift trick.\n\nWhen Murphy compares the “office access” dates with Jeffery’s airline tickets (which carry the genuine date), the whole ploy collapses.  Jeffery is confronted and arrested before he can make his flight.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  George Wilson – No motive to torpedo his own product launch; moreover he arrived after the burglary and had no system privileges to fake access logs.\n\n•  Donna Blake – Arrived at 6:10 a.m., after the theft window.  Her exhaustion is explained by preparing reports, and she lacks the computer rights needed to alter the security clock.\n\n•  Pete Thompson – His access card proves he was in the building at 1:07 a.m. and other witnesses place him at a different work site by 4:00 a.m., leaving no time to spend an hour on a safe-cracking job.  He also could not manipulate the access-control calendar.\n\nOnly Jeffery Sharp had motive (quick cash and an immediate getaway), opportunity (alone in the building between 4:15 and 6:00), and the unique technical ability to disguise the crime by changing the system date.  Therefore he is the sole culprit.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "Before going into the conference room, I asked Donna to print out the “office access” report for the last two days. I then asked her to report on what she found. She said the reports showed some confusing information. The day of the party showed, impossibly, that only two people entered the office for the entire day: First, Pete, at 1:07 a.m., and then Jeffery, at 4:15 a.m. It was blank after that. She also said that, just like on her morning reports, the dates were wrong: The one with Pete and Jeffery was dated today, and the one with her and Mr. Wilson was actually dated tomorrow.\nI explained that, since the security system would shut down office access if anyone local tried to turn it off, the thief had to find another way around it. Jeffery Sharp had been granted access to one small, but important, part of the security system: When he changes the date in the office’s computer system, it also changes it in the security system. So to hide his theft, the night he cracked the safe, he moved the date forward one day the night. He obviously hoped that no one would notice until he was safely out of the country.\nFor me, it all came together when I saw that the date on Jeffery’s tickets didn’t match the date on the access report for the day of the robbery."
