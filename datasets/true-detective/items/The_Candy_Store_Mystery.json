      "content": "Katie Johnson and Alicia Cates were best friends. The women were genuinely fond of one another, and their friendship had an added benefit: The Cates and Johnson families lived next door to each other, and so the two mothers often teamed up when working with the children and their various church and school activities. One sunny day in early spring, the moms planned a fun outing for the five kids. Katie had two girls, Emilee and Olivia, ages nine and three, respectively. Alicia had two boys and one girl: Trevor was the oldest at age six, followed by four-year-old Justin and two-year-old Brianna. Since school was out for Emilee, Katie and Alicia promised the kids a trip to the candy store at the mall. Darby’s Confectionary was not just any candy store. It was huge, with lots of floor space divided into sections that carried just about every type of sweets in existence. It even had an “Old Time Candy” department which Katie’s husband Carl loved to frequent. In fact, Katie planned to purchase a couple of packages of Sixties-era clove flavored chewing gum for him while she, Alicia and the kids visited the store. Around mid-morning, everyone piled into the Johnson SUV and headed toward the mall and Darby’s Confectionary. The children were excited, even though Katie and Alicia had set a firm rule: No candy until after lunch. They were going to the Confectionary to purchase only, and would need to save the treats for later in the afternoon. The mothers were agile young women, very quick on their feet—they needed to be when in the candy store with the children. As soon as the pleasant smell of sweets hit their little noses, the kids quickly began to spread out to explore. Katie and Alicia weren’t worried; they knew from previous experience that this was not as much of a problem as it seemed. The store was well-lit with wide aisles, and most of the candy was either behind counters or stored high enough that young children could not reach it. Besides, they had been clear about their rules for this outing, and they trusted their little ones to be respectful. The moms took their time going to the gum counter to make Katie’s purchase for Carl. Livvie, Katie’s three-year-old, went with them. Livvie had a nasty head cold and didn’t feel well, but Katie knew that missing a trip to the Confectionary would break the little girl’s heart. Livvie had suffered from the cold for several days and her mother hoped that getting out of the house and breathing some fresh air would make her feel better and restore her appetite. Emilee had offered to walk Brianna around the store, but being a typical two-year-old, Brianna became distracted by the section of the store where the brownies and cookies were displayed. These items were baked fresh every morning and kept in a glass case with a slide door and a low key lock in the back. Emilee had been distracted herself, looking at the hard candy, imagining they way they’d melt in her mouth. Before noticing that Brianna had wandered off, she considered asking her mom to buy a few ounces of heart-shaped mints. Mr. Darby was working in the hard candy section and asked her if she would like a sample. Emilee was tempted but replied that no, she had better not, as her mother would not like it if she found out. Mr. Darby grinned and told her to her to bring her mother over to see him before leaving and he would give her a small sample to take home. Emilee saw that Brianna had wandered off, and she quickly found her a couple of aisles over, staring at the blonde brownies and chocolate chip cookies. Brianna’s plump little fingers smudged the glass as she pointed out to Emilee the delicious-looking sweets. After grabbing a few packs of Carl’s favorite clove gum and visiting with the woman staffing the Old Time Candy department for a few minutes, the women found Trevor in the licorice section. There was licorice of all flavors and colors displayed but Alicia though it odd that her son would be looking in this area, for he had recently lost a tooth when falling off his bicycle and chewing was very painful. Katie, Alicia, and Trevor then met the girls in the bakery section. Emilee told her mom about her conversation with Mr. Darby, and Katie thanked her for following the no candy until after lunch rule. The last child they rounded up was Justin. Justin was a typical four-year-old boy who had gravitated to the messiest area of the store, the soft chocolate section. The section was partially roped off, as Mr. Darby was remodeling a display on a side wall and had left a step stool, paint drop cloth and some loose pieces of wood on the floor. Mr. Darby kept candy bars and chocolate drops in this area, but they were up just high enough that a small child could not get to them. After rounding up Justin and making several purchases, the moms and kids prepared to leave. They approached Mr. Darby, who was still behind the hard candy counter. “Good, you’ve come back for your free sample,” he said to Emilee, smiling. He looked at the young mothers. “But one of my clerks tells me that somebody had a snack they forgot to pay for.” Alicia and Katie spoke with the children for a few minutes, but none of them admitted to anything. Finally, Alicia said to Mr. Darby, “I know who the guilty party is without you having to tell me!”",

He asked, “How do you know?”\n“Process of elimination,” answered Alicia. Looking at her friend Katie, she said, “We moms have to be pretty good detectives sometimes.”\nMr. Darby was impressed. He said, “Well, I suppose you do. Please explain.”\nAlicia began to speak, with five very quiet children at her side. “Katie and I know that little Livvie didn’t take anything. Not only has she not been out of our sight this morning, she’s been sick with a cold and hasn’t been eating. And we know it could not have been Brianna—she was enamored of the cookies, of course, but a two-year-old could not unlock a display counter even if she had the key and all day to do it, which she didn’t. You were with Emilee in the hard candy section—that’s why we’re here, to pick up her free sample. Emilee can be a difficult nine-year-old sometimes, but she’s following the rules today.”\nAlicia stopped to catch her breath. Katie took over: “We know it wasn’t Trevor. He had a tooth knocked out a couple of days ago and his mouth is very sore. I doubt very seriously he would be chewing on licorice. Now, Alicia and I were a little bit stumped by this until we realized you are remodeling.”\nMr. Darby asked, “What does that have to do with it?”\nKatie smiled. “Easy. Justin is the only one left who could be guilty—but the chocolate is up just high enough that a four-year-old could not reach it. Then we realized you have a step stool in the area.”\nBoth moms looked at Justin, who seemed to wither before their eyes. He said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Darby. But it just looked so good. I only ate a couple of the small chocolates.”\nMr. Darby, a kind man, gently replied, “Apology accepted, Justin. I hope you’ve learned not to take what is not yours. Besides,” he added, “at Darby’s Confectionary, you may always have a free sample by simply asking for it—with your mother’s permission, of course.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nFirst, list every person who was in the store and therefore could conceivably be the “some-body” who nibbled candy without paying for it.\n\n• Adults  \n  – Katie Johnson  \n  – Alicia Cates  \n  – Mr. Darby  \n\n• Children  \n  – Emilee Johnson (9)  \n  – Olivia “Livvie” Johnson (3)  \n  – Trevor Cates (6)  \n  – Justin Cates (4)  \n  – Brianna Cates (2)  \n\nBecause the missing item was “a snack,” it is vastly more plausible that one of the children rather than an adult helped himself / herself.  Nevertheless, we will keep everyone on the list until each is eliminated.\n\n1. Motive  \n   Everyone in a candy store has motive: candy tastes good.  Motive therefore does not differentiate much here; opportunity and physical ability will be more decisive.\n\n2. Opportunity & Physical considerations  \n   • Livvie – never out of her mother’s sight and has a head cold that ruined her appetite; also stayed beside the moms at the gum counter.  \n   • Brianna – mesmerized by cookies and brownies that were locked behind a glass case.  A two-year-old lacks the dexterity and strength to work the lock.  \n   • Emilee – while briefly alone she was in the hard-candy area under Mr. Darby’s eye; she even refused a free taste because of the “no candy before lunch” rule.  \n   • Trevor – was located in the licorice aisle, but chewing is painful for him after a recent bicycle accident knocked out a tooth.  He logically would avoid candy that must be chewed.  \n   • Justin – discovered in the only part of the store that was roped off for remodeling: the soft-chocolate section.  In that area a step-stool, drop cloth and loose boards were lying about.  The soft chocolates are stored on a shelf just high enough that an ordinary four-year-old boy could not reach them from the floor—but could from the step-stool.  \n   • Katie & Alicia – together the whole time, busy herding children, and certainly would not sneak candy in front of their own rule-enforcement.  \n   • Mr. Darby – owner, no reason to steal from himself and was behind the hard-candy counter during the episode.\n\n3. Physical evidence / tell-tale facts  \n   – Missing chocolates came from the soft-chocolate section (implied by Mr. Darby).  \n   – That section alone had a stool available for a short person to climb.  \n   – The only child found wandering there was Justin.  \n   – Chocolate is something a four-year-old could readily eat despite having all his teeth (unlike Trevor with a sore mouth).  \n\n4. Logical deduction  \n   a) Remove Livvie: constant adult supervision, sick, no appetite.  \n   b) Remove Brianna: locked case beyond her capacity.  \n   c) Remove Emilee: was under Mr. Darby’s direct sight.  \n   d) Remove Trevor: sore mouth, was in another aisle, licorice would hurt to chew, could not reach chocolate anyway.  \n   e) The only child left with both opportunity (alone in the section, access to step-stool) and ability (healthy mouth, likes messy things) is Justin.  \n\nTherefore Justin Cates is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nKatie Johnson, Alicia Cates, Mr. Darby, Emilee Johnson, Olivia \"Livvie\" Johnson, Trevor Cates, Justin Cates, Brianna Cates\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJustin Cates\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhile the two mothers were occupied at the gum counter with three-year-old Livvie, the children dispersed through the aisles.  \n• Emilee followed Brianna toward the bakery, then doubled back to the hard-candy aisle to chat with Mr. Darby.  \n• Trevor lingered in the licorice section, harmlessly examining packages he could not comfortably eat.  \n• Justin, left to his own devices, headed for the soft-chocolate area, which happened to be half-roped-off for remodeling.  There he found a handy step-stool that Mr. Darby had left for repainting the wall display.  \n• Justin pulled the stool into position, climbed up, reached the shelf, and helped himself to “a couple of the small chocolates.”  After popping them quickly into his mouth he pushed the stool back roughly where he had found it, leaving no obvious trace.  \n• Moments later the mothers gathered everyone to leave.  A clerk informed Mr. Darby that some chocolates were missing, prompting his comment about the unpaid snack.  \n• Applying simple elimination—who was supervised, who had the physical capacity, and who had access via the stool—Alicia and Katie concluded in unison that Justin must have been the one.  \n• Confronted, Justin confessed and apologized, closing the case.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nKatie Johnson & Alicia Cates – They were enforcing the “no candy until after lunch” rule and remained together. No reason to steal from a store in front of their children.  \nMr. Darby – Owner of the merchandise; theft makes no sense. He never left his post behind the counter.  \nEmilee Johnson – Watched by Mr. Darby in the hard-candy aisle; she even declined a free sample until later.  \nOlivia “Livvie” Johnson – Sick, listless, continually beside her mother, zero opportunity.  \nTrevor Cates – Recently lost a tooth; chewing hurts. He stayed in the licorice aisle and had no motive to seek chocolate.  \nBrianna Cates – Only two; the brownies and cookies were locked behind glass she couldn’t open.  \nTherefore none of them had both the means and opportunity, leaving only Justin Cates.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "Mr. Darby was used to young children giving in to temptation in his store and was not angry. But he was surprised at Alicia’s words. He asked, “How do you know?”\n“Process of elimination,” answered Alicia. Looking at her friend Katie, she said, “We moms have to be pretty good detectives sometimes.”\nMr. Darby was impressed. He said, “Well, I suppose you do. Please explain.”\nAlicia began to speak, with five very quiet children at her side. “Katie and I know that little Livvie didn’t take anything. Not only has she not been out of our sight this morning, she’s been sick with a cold and hasn’t been eating. And we know it could not have been Brianna—she was enamored of the cookies, of course, but a two-year-old could not unlock a display counter even if she had the key and all day to do it, which she didn’t. You were with Emilee in the hard candy section—that’s why we’re here, to pick up her free sample. Emilee can be a difficult nine-year-old sometimes, but she’s following the rules today.”\nAlicia stopped to catch her breath. Katie took over: “We know it wasn’t Trevor. He had a tooth knocked out a couple of days ago and his mouth is very sore. I doubt very seriously he would be chewing on licorice. Now, Alicia and I were a little bit stumped by this until we realized you are remodeling.”\nMr. Darby asked, “What does that have to do with it?”\nKatie smiled. “Easy. Justin is the only one left who could be guilty—but the chocolate is up just high enough that a four-year-old could not reach it. Then we realized you have a step stool in the area.”\nBoth moms looked at Justin, who seemed to wither before their eyes. He said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Darby. But it just looked so good. I only ate a couple of the small chocolates.”\nMr. Darby, a kind man, gently replied, “Apology accepted, Justin. I hope you’ve learned not to take what is not yours. Besides,” he added, “at Darby’s Confectionary, you may always have a free sample by simply asking for it—with your mother’s permission, of course.”"
