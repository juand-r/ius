      "content": "It was only 1:00 p.m. on the first day of the company retreat in Hawaii, but already all the employees from Masterson Technologies had sunburns redder than the volcanic red Hawaiian sea salt they’d sprinkled on their feast at the luau the night before. Craig Willis’ face, however, turned an ashen grey when he saw the dead body in the small pool reserved for Masterson’s top five employees. Well, make that top four. Craig recognized the body as belonging to Trevor Jones, Masterson’s president. A firm believer in remaining physically fit at 50, Trevor’s leadership style reflected his fitness regimen -- no slacking off allowed, period. And since he often extended that to expecting those working under him to work through lunch and not take their rightful breaks, this retreat was the first time he’d ever socialized with his employees. At 32, Craig was a vice president of Masterson Technologies. He didn’t get that high up the corporate ladder that fast by shying away from difficult situations, but his first instinct here was to turn and walk away. A local police officer approached him, pushing all thoughts of running away out of his mind. “I’m Detective Kawika Akana. Are you Craig Willis?” he asked. “Yes.” “Good. That means we have all the suspects in one place. Come join your colleagues.” The detective indicated for Craig to go sit with his co-workers at a poolside table. “Are you just going to leave Trevor floating there?” Craig asked. “I’ve already determined that he was murdered,” the detective said. “The medical examiner will be here soon to confirm that he was forcibly drowned. In the meantime, I’m going to find out which of you killed Mr. Jones …” Craig didn’t know how to reply to that, so he sat down next to Niles Anderson, the company’s 45-year-old accountant. Stephanie Clark, the marketing VP sat on the other side of Niles, and next to her was the office manager, Amanda Kent. Both women were in their fifties, but they couldn’t be more different -- Stephanie an avid cyclist and Amanda an unrepentant couch potato. Detective Akana eyed the four Masterson employees thoughtfully. “So this is some sort of corporate retreat?” he asked. “Yes,” Amanda replied. “I suggested it. The employee morale level is really low. I figured those of us running the company had to improve our work situation first, then maybe our job satisfaction could trickle down through the ranks.” “Hah!” Niles said. “You’re talking like Trevor now.” To Amanda’s questioning look, he explained, “You said ‘trickle down through the ranks’ -- that’s Trevor’s army talk.” “Was Mr. Jones in the military?” Akana asked. “No,” Niles said, “but his father was. He acted like a drill sergeant more than a businessman. I blame the low morale on him. He never smiled, he never complimented anyone, and he discouraged employee fraternization.” “Truth is,” Amanda said, “the retreat was meant as an intervention. We were going to try to get him to relax and have fun, then confront him with our gripes.” “Yeah,” Stephanie said, “we hoped that outside the office he’d be more open to listening to us.” “But no such luck,” Craig said. “We arrived in time for a late dinner yesterday, but he got things off to an uncomfortable start with his sourpuss behavior. He refused to drink the free punch at the luau and rebuffed the pretty dancer who tried to get him on stage, and then this morning he said that he thought this retreat was a waste of time.” “And money,” Niles said. “He counted every penny so many times that he might as well have been doing my job.” “Meaning you’re the accountant?” Akana asked. “Yes, and I can assure you that the company will not suffer for this trip. In fact, we all could have brought our spouses without making a dent in the profit margins.” “Hmm,” Akana said. “If the company is doing that well, maybe Jones wasn’t such a bad leader.” “There’s more to life than money,” Craig said. “Mr. Jones no longer has a life,” Akana said. After a dead silence, the detective continued. “Okay, so none of you liked him and all of you were with him this morning, correct?” “Well, no,” Niles said, “I met up with everyone at the lunch buffet. I guess I ate some bad Poke last night, because I was up most of the night with stomach pains, then I slept in, and didn’t leave my room until I went to meet everyone for lunch.” “I’m not surprised,” Amanda said. “I feel sick just thinking about all the raw fish you ate.” “You are so old-fashioned,” Stephanie said to Amanda. “Everyone eats sushi nowadays. But maybe that explains it -- you’re afraid of fish!” It was obvious that Stephanie was just ribbing Amanda in a friendly manner, but the office manager seemed embarrassed in front of Akana. “Are we talking about why I won’t go swimming again … I nearly drowned as a little girl, so what – I’m terrified of water. But I don’t have a fish phobia. It’s not like I was attacked by a shark or anything. And in case you’ve forgotten, I told you just last night how much I enjoyed the Mahi Mahi.” Stephanie put up her hands in defeat. “Okay, okay, you win. I don’t think the detective wants to hear us two hens going at it, anyway.” Akana smiled. “However you normally behave around each other helps me paint a picture of the broader scenario in my mind,” he said. “So go on …” Amanda grinned. “Well, since she takes such good care of herself, I like to bug her about how great she looks for her age. But I think Stephanie must’ve just dyed the grey out of her hair yesterday because she took special care not to get it wet.” “Amanda!” Stephanie exclaimed. “But you’re right, I dyed it yesterday and I’m a little concerned about the chlorine because I heard it can turn blonde hair green. Now since you brought up my hair, should we talk about your latest diet …?” “Truce,” Amanda said. “It’s obvious there’s no love lost with Jones, the way you’re acting like everything’s normal,” Akana said. “Give them a break,” Niles said, “everybody mourns in their own way.” “I’m just trying not to think about the body,” Craig said, nonetheless glancing at it. “Do we have to sit here much longer?” “No,” Akana said, “I just want to clarify a couple more things. “Why didn’t Mr. Jones go with you to lunch?” “He’d decided to swim 100 laps and he intended to finish,” Craig said. “In fact, he chastised us for not joining him.” “Who was the last person at the pool with him?” “We all left for lunch together,” Craig said. “But then we all went to our rooms before meeting back up at the buffet. So I guess that means none of us have an alibi …” “True,” Akana said, “but only one of you is a murderer. And I know who.”",

          "reveal_text": "“How do you know?” Craig asked. “I didn’t hear anyone say anything incriminating.”\n“It’s not always what people say that gives them away,” Akana replied. “For instance, you should’ve seen your face when I first met you. Seeing that body made you turn pale -- you can’t fake that kind of reaction. It’s obvious you’ve never seen a dead body in person before, much less killed someone.\n“And the women absolved each other,” Akana said. “Stephanie revealed that Amanda’s afraid of swimming and Amanda revealed that Stephanie didn’t want to get her hair wet. Well, there’s no way either of them could’ve overpowered Mr. Jones long enough to drown him, not with Amanda lacking confidence in the water and Stephanie’s hair remaining dry.”\nNiles brayed out a laugh. “So, what? Process of elimination says it’s me? You’ve got the wrong man,” he said.\n“Process of elimination usually tells me what I need to know,” the detective said. “But the most common thing is for the guilty party to give themselves away. Like for instance, you lied to me.”\nThe others turned and stared at Niles. He scratched at his sunburn nervously. “I did no such thing.”\n“You said you didn’t leave your room until you went to lunch …”\n“Yeah, that’s right.”\n“You may not have been at this pool this morning, but you weren’t in your room, either.” Akana pointed at where Niles’ was scratching. “You just arrived yesterday evening, yet you’re sunburned, so you must’ve been in the sun today. So I know you did it, I just don’t know why.”\nNiles looked around, as if calculating his chance for escape, but what was he going to do -- swim home from Hawaii? He sighed, defeated. “It’s a big resort,” he said. “I went to the wrong pool this morning and by the time I’d figured it out, I was already settled in on a lounge chair with a good book, so I didn’t feel like moving. I swung by here on my way to lunch and found Trevor swimming alone. He said we were all supposed to stick together on the retreat and accused me of ‘slacking off’ this morning. It was just such a ridiculous a thing for him to get on my case about -- yet so typical of how he treats us -- that I got this uncontrollable urge to make him shut up … for good.”\nAkana shook his head in dismay. “And now I have an uncontrollable urge to read you your rights.”",

Please read the story carefully before you decide who the culprit is.\n\n\nIt was only 1:00 p.m. on the first day of the company retreat in Hawaii, but already all the employees from Masterson Technologies had sunburns redder than the volcanic red Hawaiian sea salt they’d sprinkled on their feast at the luau the night before. Craig Willis’ face, however, turned an ashen grey when he saw the dead body in the small pool reserved for Masterson’s top five employees. Well, make that top four. Craig recognized the body as belonging to Trevor Jones, Masterson’s president. A firm believer in remaining physically fit at 50, Trevor’s leadership style reflected his fitness regimen -- no slacking off allowed, period. And since he often extended that to expecting those working under him to work through lunch and not take their rightful breaks, this retreat was the first time he’d ever socialized with his employees. At 32, Craig was a vice president of Masterson Technologies. He didn’t get that high up the corporate ladder that fast by shying away from difficult situations, but his first instinct here was to turn and walk away. A local police officer approached him, pushing all thoughts of running away out of his mind. “I’m Detective Kawika Akana. Are you Craig Willis?” he asked. “Yes.” “Good. That means we have all the suspects in one place. Come join your colleagues.” The detective indicated for Craig to go sit with his co-workers at a poolside table. “Are you just going to leave Trevor floating there?” Craig asked. “I’ve already determined that he was murdered,” the detective said. “The medical examiner will be here soon to confirm that he was forcibly drowned. In the meantime, I’m going to find out which of you killed Mr. Jones …” Craig didn’t know how to reply to that, so he sat down next to Niles Anderson, the company’s 45-year-old accountant. Stephanie Clark, the marketing VP sat on the other side of Niles, and next to her was the office manager, Amanda Kent. Both women were in their fifties, but they couldn’t be more different -- Stephanie an avid cyclist and Amanda an unrepentant couch potato. Detective Akana eyed the four Masterson employees thoughtfully. “So this is some sort of corporate retreat?” he asked. “Yes,” Amanda replied. “I suggested it. The employee morale level is really low. I figured those of us running the company had to improve our work situation first, then maybe our job satisfaction could trickle down through the ranks.” “Hah!” Niles said. “You’re talking like Trevor now.” To Amanda’s questioning look, he explained, “You said ‘trickle down through the ranks’ -- that’s Trevor’s army talk.” “Was Mr. Jones in the military?” Akana asked. “No,” Niles said, “but his father was. He acted like a drill sergeant more than a businessman. I blame the low morale on him. He never smiled, he never complimented anyone, and he discouraged employee fraternization.” “Truth is,” Amanda said, “the retreat was meant as an intervention. We were going to try to get him to relax and have fun, then confront him with our gripes.” “Yeah,” Stephanie said, “we hoped that outside the office he’d be more open to listening to us.” “But no such luck,” Craig said. “We arrived in time for a late dinner yesterday, but he got things off to an uncomfortable start with his sourpuss behavior. He refused to drink the free punch at the luau and rebuffed the pretty dancer who tried to get him on stage, and then this morning he said that he thought this retreat was a waste of time.” “And money,” Niles said. “He counted every penny so many times that he might as well have been doing my job.” “Meaning you’re the accountant?” Akana asked. “Yes, and I can assure you that the company will not suffer for this trip. In fact, we all could have brought our spouses without making a dent in the profit margins.” “Hmm,” Akana said. “If the company is doing that well, maybe Jones wasn’t such a bad leader.” “There’s more to life than money,” Craig said. “Mr. Jones no longer has a life,” Akana said. After a dead silence, the detective continued. “Okay, so none of you liked him and all of you were with him this morning, correct?” “Well, no,” Niles said, “I met up with everyone at the lunch buffet. I guess I ate some bad Poke last night, because I was up most of the night with stomach pains, then I slept in, and didn’t leave my room until I went to meet everyone for lunch.” “I’m not surprised,” Amanda said. “I feel sick just thinking about all the raw fish you ate.” “You are so old-fashioned,” Stephanie said to Amanda. “Everyone eats sushi nowadays. But maybe that explains it -- you’re afraid of fish!” It was obvious that Stephanie was just ribbing Amanda in a friendly manner, but the office manager seemed embarrassed in front of Akana. “Are we talking about why I won’t go swimming again … I nearly drowned as a little girl, so what – I’m terrified of water. But I don’t have a fish phobia. It’s not like I was attacked by a shark or anything. And in case you’ve forgotten, I told you just last night how much I enjoyed the Mahi Mahi.” Stephanie put up her hands in defeat. “Okay, okay, you win. I don’t think the detective wants to hear us two hens going at it, anyway.” Akana smiled. “However you normally behave around each other helps me paint a picture of the broader scenario in my mind,” he said. “So go on …” Amanda grinned. “Well, since she takes such good care of herself, I like to bug her about how great she looks for her age. But I think Stephanie must’ve just dyed the grey out of her hair yesterday because she took special care not to get it wet.” “Amanda!” Stephanie exclaimed. “But you’re right, I dyed it yesterday and I’m a little concerned about the chlorine because I heard it can turn blonde hair green. Now since you brought up my hair, should we talk about your latest diet …?” “Truce,” Amanda said. “It’s obvious there’s no love lost with Jones, the way you’re acting like everything’s normal,” Akana said. “Give them a break,” Niles said, “everybody mourns in their own way.” “I’m just trying not to think about the body,” Craig said, nonetheless glancing at it. “Do we have to sit here much longer?” “No,” Akana said, “I just want to clarify a couple more things. “Why didn’t Mr. Jones go with you to lunch?” “He’d decided to swim 100 laps and he intended to finish,” Craig said. “In fact, he chastised us for not joining him.” “Who was the last person at the pool with him?” “We all left for lunch together,” Craig said. “But then we all went to our rooms before meeting back up at the buffet. So I guess that means none of us have an alibi …” “True,” Akana said, “but only one of you is a murderer. And I know who.”\n“How do you know?” Craig asked. “I didn’t hear anyone say anything incriminating.”\n“It’s not always what people say that gives them away,” Akana replied. “For instance, you should’ve seen your face when I first met you. Seeing that body made you turn pale -- you can’t fake that kind of reaction. It’s obvious you’ve never seen a dead body in person before, much less killed someone.\n“And the women absolved each other,” Akana said. “Stephanie revealed that Amanda’s afraid of swimming and Amanda revealed that Stephanie didn’t want to get her hair wet. Well, there’s no way either of them could’ve overpowered Mr. Jones long enough to drown him, not with Amanda lacking confidence in the water and Stephanie’s hair remaining dry.”\nNiles brayed out a laugh. “So, what? Process of elimination says it’s me? You’ve got the wrong man,” he said.\n“Process of elimination usually tells me what I need to know,” the detective said. “But the most common thing is for the guilty party to give themselves away. Like for instance, you lied to me.”\nThe others turned and stared at Niles. He scratched at his sunburn nervously. “I did no such thing.”\n“You said you didn’t leave your room until you went to lunch …”\n“Yeah, that’s right.”\n“You may not have been at this pool this morning, but you weren’t in your room, either.” Akana pointed at where Niles’ was scratching. “You just arrived yesterday evening, yet you’re sunburned, so you must’ve been in the sun today. So I know you did it, I just don’t know why.”\nNiles looked around, as if calculating his chance for escape, but what was he going to do -- swim home from Hawaii? He sighed, defeated. “It’s a big resort,” he said. “I went to the wrong pool this morning and by the time I’d figured it out, I was already settled in on a lounge chair with a good book, so I didn’t feel like moving. I swung by here on my way to lunch and found Trevor swimming alone. He said we were all supposed to stick together on the retreat and accused me of ‘slacking off’ this morning. It was just such a ridiculous a thing for him to get on my case about -- yet so typical of how he treats us -- that I got this uncontrollable urge to make him shut up … for good.”\nAkana shook his head in dismay. “And now I have an uncontrollable urge to read you your rights.”\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tDetermine who could want Trevor Jones dead.  Every one of his four senior employees disliked his rigid, militaristic style, so motive alone is not enough to separate anyone.\n2.\tLook at opportunity and alibi.\n\t•\tCraig Willis – left the pool with everyone else for lunch and went to his room.  No one can confirm it, so he has no alibi, but Detective Akana sees Craig turn white at the sight of the body – the spontaneous reaction of someone who has never before faced a corpse.  That makes it unlikely he is a killer.\n\t•\tStephanie Clark – is proud of her recently-dyed blond hair and is afraid chlorine will turn it green, so she has kept it absolutely dry.  When the body is discovered her hair is still perfectly styled and bone-dry.  If she had wrestled a grown man under water only minutes earlier her hair would be wet.\n\t•\tAmanda Kent – admits a lifelong terror of deep water after nearly drowning as a child and never goes farther than ankle-deep in any pool.  For her to overpower a fit, ex-triathlete like Trevor in the deep end is next to impossible.\n\t•\tNiles Anderson – alone claims he “never left his room” until lunch because he’d been up all night with stomach pains.  But Niles is already badly sunburned after less than 24 hours on the island.  The only possible way to get that burn is to have been outdoors that morning, contradicting his story.  Thus he had both the opportunity and an obvious lie to hide it.\n3.\tPhysical evidence.\n\t•\tDry, freshly styled hair eliminates Stephanie.\n\t•\tAmanda’s aquaphobia makes a water assault unrealistic.\n\t•\tUnfeigned shock eliminates Craig.\n\t•\tNiles’ sunburn proves he was outdoors and lying about his whereabouts, putting him at the scene.\n4.\tLogical deduction.  Three suspects are either physically incapable of the act or shown to be truthful about not being in the pool area.  The only remaining person who could have done it – and who is caught in a lie – is Niles.  Confronted, he confesses, confirming the deduction.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nCraig Willis, Niles Anderson, Stephanie Clark, Amanda Kent\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nNiles Anderson\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly in the morning all five executives gathered at the private pool.  Trevor Jones announced he would swim 100 laps and badgered the others to join him.  They all left for the lunch buffet, promising to meet there after a quick stop in their rooms.\n\nNiles Anderson, who had wandered to another pool earlier and been sunbathing and reading, now walked past the executives’ pool on his way to lunch.  He found Trevor alone in mid-workout.  Trevor scolded him for “slacking off,” the same belittling tone Niles had endured for years.  Furious, Niles jumped in, grabbed Trevor from behind and held him under until he stopped struggling.  He then climbed out, dried off quickly in the tropical sun, and went to meet the others for lunch, acting as though nothing had happened.\n\nBecause he had already been lying in the sun at the wrong pool all morning, his shoulders and face were bright red – the sunburn that later betrayed the lie that he had “never left his room.”  When the group returned to the pool area at 1:00 p.m., Trevor’s body was floating face-down and Niles blended in with the horrified employees until Detective Akana noticed the inconsistency in his story.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nCraig Willis: His instantaneous pallor at the sight of the corpse was the unguarded reaction of a man who had never before faced a dead body, not the calculated performance of a murderer.  No lie or contradiction in his account surfaced.\n\nStephanie Clark:  Drowning someone requires prolonged physical contact in the water.  Stephanie’s hair was still perfectly dry and styled when the body was discovered; had she entered the pool minutes earlier it would be wet and chlorinated.  Her concern about hair dye is corroborated by Amanda, and no evidence contradicts it.\n\nAmanda Kent:  Amanda openly admits a lifelong terror of water after a childhood near-drowning.  Someone who will not even wade into the pool cannot overpower a strong swimmer and keep him submerged.  Nothing places her near the pool after the group left for lunch.\n\nThus the only person with motive, opportunity, contradicted alibi, and a confession is Niles Anderson.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
