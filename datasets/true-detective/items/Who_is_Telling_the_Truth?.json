      "content": "NOTE: The reader should have at least a passing knowledge of American history since the early 1960s to around 1990 to fully appreciate this mystery. Four of the characters in the story are lying and are “exonerated” from telling the truth. The character who is “incriminated” is telling the truth. Terry Brennan was enjoying a glass of wine before dinner with his wife of over 30 years, Rochelle. The early June evening was perfect and, as they relaxed on the spacious outside patio deck, he was explaining to her how much he had enjoyed finding several long lost friends on one of the internet’s many social networking sites. “Since signing up on E-Friends a couple of weeks ago, I have found several of our old chums from the early 1960s.” Terry and Rochelle had known each other since they met in Mrs. Bowden’s afternoon kindergarten class in the fall of 1955. Neither of them liked to be reminded that was almost 54 years ago. Taking a bite of cheese, Rochelle, asked, “So, who have you found?” Terry replied, “So far I’ve become network friends with Billy Flowers, Jane Neal, Paula Newsome, Jimmy Smith and Larry Gerard.” “Why, I remember them well!” exclaimed Rochelle. “But, I haven’t seen or heard from any of them in almost 50 years. When our family moved across town in the summer of 1961, I lost track of all of them.” Terry chuckled, “Well, our family stayed put and I lost track of them too. Friendships change when you enter junior high school.” “True,” Rochelle replied, thoughtfully, “but tell me about them.” Terry poured another glass of wine. He was in a playful mood. “Well, there is much to tell, but since we are relaxed and in no hurry this evening, allow me to relate some of the emails they have sent me. See if you can figure out which one is telling the whole truth. Four of the five old friends I have mentioned have told me some things that, simply put, cannot be 100% accurate.” There was a twinkle in her husband’s eye. Rochelle knew that whatever Terry was about to say, it would be good. She said, “I’m not certain what you are getting at, but start talking.” Terry grinned. He loved a good story and was in his element. Now, he was about to share several of them with his still lovely wife. Life was good, he thought. He began, “Well, I know you and Jane Neal were friends, so I’ll start with her. By the way, I should say before I forget that I purposefully waited until now to tell you about E-Friends. I want you to enjoy this little brainteaser I’ve prepared for you.” Rochelle smiled at Terry, saying, “I’ve already told you to start talking.” “Smiling back, he said, “OK. Jane was the first of our old childhood pals that I found. I sent her a friendship invitation and she readily accepted. In a couple of subsequent emails, she told me that her life has not been a happy one.  Disillusioned by the Vietnam War, she traveled around the country in an old tour bus with a group of Ken Kesey style merry pranksters after high school graduation. But, she had, and still possesses, a serious side. Jane worked very hard on the Robert Kennedy presidential campaign during the summer of 1968 and voted for him in the general election. Nixon’s election threw her into a several year funk. She has been married and divorced several times and has had ongoing problems with drug abuse. Today, she lives in a commune in Idaho, sort of a throwback, retro lifestyle from the 1960s. To end Jane’s story on a high note, she claims to be more at peace with herself now than she has ever been.” Rochelle and Terry were enjoying the wine, cheese and conversation. Rochelle asked, “Who’s next? “Billy Flowers,” replied Terry. I saw him occasionally when we were in high school, but he, as you, moved to a different neighborhood and I mainly saw him in White’s Grocery Store, where I worked part time to pay for that old car I bought. The last time I saw him, I think, was just before the Spring Prom in 1967. He was surprised and pleased to reunite with me on E-Friends, although we were never close friends. His life has been a bit happier than Jane’s although he’s had his ups and downs. He is happily married, has lived in New York since 1975 and has three grown children and three grandchildren. Since moving to New York, his politics have gone from conservative to liberal. Indeed, in the last presidential election before moving to New York, he voted for Barry Goldwater, and then voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976. Quite a shift in political thinking, but I do recall that Billy was always a bit of an open-minded, free spirit.” Rochelle and Terry were in no hurry for dinner as he continued. “Next is Larry Gerard. Larry was in the US State Department for almost 30 years, spending much time abroad. In fact, his two sons still live in London, his last post before retiring. Since 2003, he and his wife Linda have lived in Texas. He spends much of his time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston, doing research for a book he wishes to write on the Johnson presidency. It appears to me that Larry has had the most professional success and happiest personal life of any of those I am speaking of now.” “What about Paula Newsome?” Rochelle asked. “Paula has an interesting story. She was one of the first of our peer group to get lucky financially. After college, she joined the staff of one of the major television networks. Recall the big hoopla over the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1976. During the years 1974-76, she was instrumental in producing the historical Bicentennial Minutes television segments, which ran up until the end of 1976. The series won an Emmy award and her career and reputation were made. Today, she is retired and lives in Los Angeles. She and her husband Alan had one son, who died of cancer in 1988.” Terry paused to catch his breath and sip a little more wine. He and Rochelle were having fun and there was one more story to go. “Jimmy Smith,” he said, “almost died of injuries suffered in a car accident in 1981. A drunk driver in a brand new Ford Taurus T-boned him running through a red light. He spent several weeks in the hospital and many months in physical rehabilitation. I admire what he has done with his life since. He and his second wife Charlene opened their own rehabilitation center and have been physical therapy instructors in Kansas City for over 20 years.” Terry and Rochelle looked at each other in the mischievous ways they both loved. Terry finished his wine and asked, “So, who is telling the truth? Rochelle told her husband who she thought was telling the truth and why. Terry asked, “Would you care to explain your reasoning?”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the basic rule of the puzzle.  \n   – Exactly four of the five old classmates are lying; those four are automatically “exonerated.”  \n   – The one person who is not lying is therefore “incriminated” and is the culprit we have to name.\n\n2. List every check-able statement each classmate makes and compare it with readily verifiable facts of American history (1960-1990, as warned in the preface).\n\n   a) Jane Neal  \n      • “Worked very hard on the Robert Kennedy presidential campaign during the summer of 1968.”  \n      • “Voted for him in the general election.”  \n      FACT CHECK: Robert F. Kennedy was shot June 5 and died June 6, 1968; he was therefore not alive (and certainly not running) during “the summer,” nor was he on the November ballot.  Both claims are impossible ➔ Jane is lying.\n\n   b) Billy Flowers  \n      • “Voted for Barry Goldwater in the last presidential election before moving to New York (1972).”  \n      FACT CHECK: Goldwater was the Republican nominee only in 1964.  In 1972 the GOP nominee was Richard Nixon.  While a write-in vote is physically possible, the plain-language intent of the sentence is that Goldwater was a normal candidate, which is historically false ➔ Billy is lying.\n\n   c) Larry Gerard  \n      • “Spends much of his time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston.”  \n      FACT CHECK: The LBJ Library is on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin, not Houston ➔ Larry is lying.\n\n   d) Jimmy Smith  \n      • “Was hit in 1981 by a drunk driver in a brand-new Ford Taurus.”  \n      FACT CHECK: The Ford Taurus was not introduced until the 1986 model year (late 1985) ➔ Jimmy is lying.\n\n   e) Paula Newsome  \n      • “Helped produce the CBS ‘Bicentennial Minutes,’ which aired 1974-1976, celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.”  \n      • “The series won an Emmy the last year it ran.”  \n      FACT CHECK: The Bicentennial Minutes did in fact air from July 4 1974 to December 31 1976 and received a 1976 Emmy.  Both statements are accurate ➔ Paula is telling the truth.\n\n3. Because exactly four people must be lying, the only consistent solution is:  \n   – Jane, Billy, Larry, Jimmy = liars (therefore innocent).  \n   – Paula = truth-teller (therefore the single “culprit”).\n\n4. Motive / opportunity / evidence: in this stylized puzzle the “crime” is simply being the one who tells the truth while everyone else lies, so motive/opportunity boils down to having the correct historical knowledge and stating it accurately.  Paula, a professional television researcher, fits that bill perfectly.\n\nTherefore Paula Newsome is the culprit.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJane Neal, Billy Flowers, Larry Gerard, Paula Newsome, Jimmy Smith\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nPaula Newsome\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nWhen Terry Brennan re-connected with his five kindergarten pals, each sent him a short life résumé.  Four of them casually or carelessly inserted historical impossibilities—wrong election years, wrong locations, nonexistent car models.  Only one classmate, Paula Newsome, the former television researcher, recited verifiably correct facts: the exact run of CBS’s Bicentennial Minutes and its Emmy win in 1976.  By the rules Terry laid down (“four lie, one tells the truth; the truth-teller is incriminated”) Paula’s spot-on account singles her out.  Thus, while everyone else is cleared by their demonstrable falsehoods, Paula’s accuracy convicts her as the lone “culprit.”\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Jane Neal: Claimed she campaigned for—and later voted for—Robert F. Kennedy after his June 1968 assassination.  Impossible.  Proven liar ➔ exonerated.\n\n• Billy Flowers: Said he voted for Barry Goldwater in the 1972 presidential election.  Goldwater was not a candidate in 1972.  Proven liar ➔ exonerated.\n\n• Larry Gerard: Placed the LBJ Presidential Library in Houston instead of Austin.  Historical/geographical error.  Proven liar ➔ exonerated.\n\n• Jimmy Smith: Described being struck in 1981 by a “brand-new” Ford Taurus, a model that did not exist until 1986.  Proven liar ➔ exonerated.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "Rochelle was now a bit light-headed from the wine and eager for dinner, so she spoke quickly. “Jane was lying. Robert Kennedy was shot on June 5 and died a day later on June 6, 1968. She could not have worked on his campaign all summer and then voted for him in the general election. Billy Flowers was lying, too. He’s another one who doesn’t remember his history right. He could not have voted for Barry Goldwater in 1972. Goldwater ran against Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The same goes for Larry Gerard. The Johnson presidential library is in Austin, not Houston. Now, Jimmy Smith’s story is not political, but he too has his facts wrong. If he was injured in 1981, he could not have been hit by a Ford Taurus. They were not introduced until model year 1986.”\n“So,” Terry said,’ “that leaves Jane.”\n“Yes, it does,” replied Rochelle, who arose from her patio seat to go inside. “She told the truth about the Bicentennial Minutes. They ran from 1974-76 and won an Emmy during the last year. That’s how she became wealthy and well known.”"
