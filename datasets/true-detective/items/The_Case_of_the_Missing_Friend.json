      "content": "Thursday night, November 21, 1963. The weather was mild in Oklahoma City and the five friends gathered in the small apartment of Steve Collier to study for tomorrow’s upcoming exams. They were all college students and not only were there tests to be taken tomorrow, the holiday season and final exams were creeping nearer and nearer. The evening was uneventful. All of them were seniors and had been friends for many years. Billy and Susan had dated for a while a couple of years ago but had broken up amicably and remained friends. Tonight was study night; tomorrow would be Friday night and time for weekend partying. Harrell left for home first, around 9:30. Harrell lived north of town and liked a good night’s sleep before test taking. Since he lived with his parents, Harrell used Steve’s telephone to call and tell his parents, he was on the way. It usually took about 20 minutes for him to drive from Steve’s apartment in near north Oklahoma City to his home farther out north. Billy and Susan left next, at 9:50. The campus was a couple miles from Steve’s apartment and occasionally Susan would walk back to her room when the weather was nice and if it was not too late, for curfew was at 11:00 and, after that, nobody could come in or out of the building until next morning. However, tonight she was tired and she gratefully accepted Billy’s offer of a ride. When he drove her home, Billy would escort her into the building reception desk, and then drive to his home in south Oklahoma City. However, he was a little farther out and the roads were rougher and darker than those Harrell traveled when returning home from Steve’s. In fact, several times Billy’s father called Steve when Billy was late in getting home. Diana was the last to leave, but it was not until almost 11:00. Diana lived with her parents, closer to Steve’s apartment than Billy or Harrell. Ever since she was a little girl, Diana loved to travel the dirt road around the east side of the lake when returning home. A very petite young woman, normally she very comfortably drove a Volkswagen but tonight she was in her father’s Cadillac and felt older than her 22 years, for a Cadillac was an “old people’s car”. Normally, Diana was not able to use her Dad’s car, but since her parents were on vacation till Friday, she was able to upgrade to the much bigger Cadillac. After Diana departed, Steve did what little cleaning up was needed and went to bed. Little did he know then that tomorrow, one of his friends would be missing. In large part because of the tragic events in Dallas, which were now a little more than 12 hours away, nobody would be certain what happened until after President Kennedy’s funeral. The next day, what would become known as the “Crime of the Century” happened at approximately 12:30 P.M. Oklahoma time, or CST, Central Standard Time, By 1:00 P.M. President Kennedy was pronounced dead and 75 million Americans would know of the shooting. That afternoon, overloaded telephone systems were breaking down all over the country and there were roadblocks as far north as Tulsa in Oklahoma, just in case Lee Harvey Oswald had not worked alone in murdering the president. The case of Steve Collier’s missing friend simply slipped through the cracks, for nobody knew for certain there was a disappearance until after the shooting in Dallas’ Dealey Plaza. The missing person’s family did not decide to notify the authorities until around noon as the missing student was an adult who had spent the night out unannounced before. When they attempted to place the call at a little after one they could not get through. They were not able to get through to the police department switchboard until early Friday evening. By then, police forces all over the country were dealing with a possible national security issue – maybe even the cold war with the USSR was heating up to a live one. A harried and overworked local police force could only do so much. So, Steve would not learn of his missing friend until Tuesday the 26th. Normally, news of a missing person would be all over the news in Oklahoma City, still a small town at heart in 1963. But, the shock of Friday night and Saturday had not worn off when Oswald himself was murdered late Sunday morning by Jack Ruby on national television at 11:21 A.M. CST. President Kennedy’s funeral was the next day, Monday, so there was no resemblance of anything normal until Tuesday morning. Steve, as did most Americans during that long nightmarish weekend, sat glued to his television set, scarcely aware of other events going on in the world, such as the tragic fire on Saturday at the Golden Age Nursing home in Fitchville, Ohio, which killed 63 of the 84 residents. Indeed, the streets of Oklahoma City were almost entirely devoid of traffic until after the president’s funeral. For three days, Oklahoma City resembled a ghost town to those few who were out and about. But, finally, on Tuesday a sad and sorrowful nation went back to work. Steve’s already overloaded senses were given another shock when Oklahoma City Police Lieutenant Rick Petit knocked on his apartment door early Tuesday afternoon. Steve had attended class that morning and had heard nothing concerning anyone being missing. After Lieutenant Petit explained his friend’s disappearance after leaving the apartment Thursday evening and his knowledge of the Thursday evening study session, Steve fought through the emotional numbness he felt, thought for a few moments and said to the officer, “I know who is missing without you having to tell me.”",

          "reveal_text": "Lieutenant Petit, who had slept little since Thursday evening, numbly replied, “Excuse me?”\nSteve looked at the lieutenant and said, gently, “Well, excuse me, Lieutenant. I know you probably don’t know as much about this as you would if the president had not been shot.”\n“That’s safe to say,” Petit replied, dryly.\n“Then let me explain. It’s easier to tell you who is not missing. I know that it cannot be Susan, even though I did not see her since Thursday night. Not only did Billy take her back to her dorm, but word of her not returning would have been all over campus this morning, which it wasn’t.”\nPetit nodded his head, not mentioning that Susan Allen was properly logged back in Thursday evening at the dormitory reception desk and that she stayed in her room all weekend, still in grief and shock over the slain president.\nSteve continued, “It couldn’t have been Billy either. If Billy had not returned home, his worry-wart dad would have called me. He’s done it before.”\nAgain, Petit nodded, but he was nodding in such a way as not to confirm or deny what Steve was saying. Petit knew that Billy Friend was another of the group who stayed away from class since Friday.\n“Harrell had to have made it home. I know that is where he was heading because he called his parents before leaving. Since his parents were home, they would have reported him missing.\nPetit said, evenly, “So, you know it was Diana Scott who is missing.”\n“Yes, it’s got to be her. I suppose you know that she was in her dad’s car Thursday night.” Steve shuddered, “She always drives home around Lake Hefner. She is a short girl and Mr. Scott’s Caddy is huge. I bet she lost control on that dark and bumpy lake road.” More importantly, her parents were on vacation, so they would not have been there to report her missing.\nAFTERWARD\nWednesday morning, November 27. Mr. Scott’s Cadillac was hoisted out of a shallow inlet by the lake road running alongside. Diana’s dead body was slumped against the steering wheel. Apparently, she had been knocked unconscious when hitting the water. Lieutenant Petit was both saddened and relieved to find the body; relieved because this completed the search for Diana Scott before the Thanksgiving weekend began, saddened because he would have to inform her parents of the bad news and ruin their holiday.\nPetit noticed that the Cadillac’s dashboard clock was stopped at 11:10, fitting perfectly with what Steve Collier had told him. He would think often in the years to come that young Miss Petit died less than an hour before that fateful day of November 22, 1963, commenced at midnight.\n\nNOTE: While this story is a work of fiction, much of it is taken from a little known occurrence in Oklahoma City. On the evening of Thursday, November 21, 1963, a woman and her daughter left the home of friends to return to their home approximately five miles away. They were never seen or heard of again, until in the spring of 1990, when a small inlet off of Lake Hefner was drained and filled for an interstate highway project. The car and remains of the missing women were found in the lakebed, the dashboard clock indicating they had driven into the lake in late evening. The local police departments admitted that, had they not been so preoccupied with the Kennedy murder the next day, 200 miles south in Dallas, they would probably have been discovered the missing women much earlier. Known as the Elston case, this was, at the time of discovery, the oldest open case in the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation.",

On the evening of Thursday, November 21, 1963, a woman and her daughter left the home of friends to return to their home approximately five miles away. They were never seen or heard of again, until in the spring of 1990, when a small inlet off of Lake Hefner was drained and filled for an interstate highway project. The car and remains of the missing women were found in the lakebed, the dashboard clock indicating they had driven into the lake in late evening. The local police departments admitted that, had they not been so preoccupied with the Kennedy murder the next day, 200 miles south in Dallas, they would probably have been discovered the missing women much earlier. Known as the Elston case, this was, at the time of discovery, the oldest open case in the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation.\n\nPlease analyze all the clues and evidence presented in the story and identify who the culprit is.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive \n   • No one in the story is shown to have a reason to harm Diana.  \n   • There are no love triangles, inheritances, jealousies or quarrels involving her.  \n   • The only tension mentioned is the nation-wide stress caused by the Kennedy assassination – nothing personal.\n\n2. Opportunity \n   • Steve went to bed immediately after Diana left; nothing places him back on the road.  \n   • Harrell was already home 40 min before Diana started her drive.  \n   • Billy was clear across town taking Susan to the dorm, then heading south to his own home.  \n   • Susan never left her residence after being dropped off.  \n   • No strangers are even hinted at being on the lonely dirt road.  \n   • Diana alone was on that road in the only car involved in the incident.\n\n3. Physical evidence / alibis \n   • The Cadillac is found intact in a shallow inlet; no signs of collision with another vehicle or human interference.  \n   • The dashboard clock stopped at 11:10 p.m., ten minutes after she left Steve’s – exactly the time a solo driver would reach the spot.  \n   • There are no wounds on Diana inconsistent with an auto accident (she was “slumped against the wheel,” apparently knocked out when the car hit the water).  \n   • Steve’s, Billy’s, Harrell’s, and Susan’s whereabouts are all independently corroborated: phone call, dorm sign-in sheet, parents’ supervision.\n\n4. Logical deduction \n   • A fatal slide off a dark, bumpy, lakeside dirt road in an unfamiliar, oversized car driven by a petite woman explains everything without invoking foul play.  \n   • Because the nation’s attention was consumed by the Kennedy assassination, a routine search for a missing adult was fatally delayed, but that does not create a human “culprit.”  \n   • Therefore the only “responsible party” is the accident itself; there is no murderer.\n\nConclusion: Diana’s death was accidental. No one killed her.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nSteve Collier, Billy Friend, Susan Allen, Harrell (“last name unstated”), Unknown Stranger, Diana Scott (herself), Nobody\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nNo one – the death was an accident (Diana Scott’s own loss of control of the car)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n22-year-old Diana Scott left Steve Collier’s apartment a few minutes before 11 p.m. on Thursday, 21 Nov 1963.  Enjoying her habitual late-night drive, she took the rough dirt road that skirts the east side of Lake Hefner.  Unused to the size and weight of her father’s Cadillac, she misjudged a bend or hit a rut, skidded off the un-railed shoulder and plunged into the shallow inlet.  The impact stunned her; the car settled in the water and she drowned, the dashboard clock stopping at 11:10 p.m. Because her parents were on vacation and the entire country was transfixed by the assassination of President Kennedy the following day, her disappearance went unnoticed until Tuesday.  The car—and her body—were finally recovered on Wednesday morning, 27 Nov 1963.\n\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Steve Collier: Went to bed after Diana left; no physical way to be on the lakeside road at 11:10 p.m.  \n• Billy Friend: Was signing Susan into her dorm around 10:00 p.m. and then driving home southward; his worried father would have reported any lateness (and did not).  \n• Susan Allen: Logged in at the dorm at 10 p.m. and never left.  \n• Harrell: Telephoned his parents at 9:30 p.m., arrived home about 9:50, and stayed there.  \n• Unknown Stranger: No evidence—tire marks, collision damage, wounds—points to interference by another person.  \n• Diana herself: She did not intend suicide; she simply lost control.  Her action is tragic but not criminal, so she is not legally a “culprit.”\n\nThus every living person in the narrative is cleared; the only “killer” was an unfortunate accident on a dark road.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

          "reveal_segment": "Lieutenant Petit, who had slept little since Thursday evening, numbly replied, “Excuse me?”\nSteve looked at the lieutenant and said, gently, “Well, excuse me, Lieutenant. I know you probably don’t know as much about this as you would if the president had not been shot.”\n“That’s safe to say,” Petit replied, dryly.\n“Then let me explain. It’s easier to tell you who is not missing. I know that it cannot be Susan, even though I did not see her since Thursday night. Not only did Billy take her back to her dorm, but word of her not returning would have been all over campus this morning, which it wasn’t.”\nPetit nodded his head, not mentioning that Susan Allen was properly logged back in Thursday evening at the dormitory reception desk and that she stayed in her room all weekend, still in grief and shock over the slain president.\nSteve continued, “It couldn’t have been Billy either. If Billy had not returned home, his worry-wart dad would have called me. He’s done it before.”\nAgain, Petit nodded, but he was nodding in such a way as not to confirm or deny what Steve was saying. Petit knew that Billy Friend was another of the group who stayed away from class since Friday.\n“Harrell had to have made it home. I know that is where he was heading because he called his parents before leaving. Since his parents were home, they would have reported him missing.\nPetit said, evenly, “So, you know it was Diana Scott who is missing.”\n“Yes, it’s got to be her. I suppose you know that she was in her dad’s car Thursday night.” Steve shuddered, “She always drives home around Lake Hefner. She is a short girl and Mr. Scott’s Caddy is huge. I bet she lost control on that dark and bumpy lake road.” More importantly, her parents were on vacation, so they would not have been there to report her missing.\nAFTERWARD\nWednesday morning, November 27. Mr. Scott’s Cadillac was hoisted out of a shallow inlet by the lake road running alongside. Diana’s dead body was slumped against the steering wheel. Apparently, she had been knocked unconscious when hitting the water. Lieutenant Petit was both saddened and relieved to find the body; relieved because this completed the search for Diana Scott before the Thanksgiving weekend began, saddened because he would have to inform her parents of the bad news and ruin their holiday.\nPetit noticed that the Cadillac’s dashboard clock was stopped at 11:10, fitting perfectly with what Steve Collier had told him. He would think often in the years to come that young Miss Petit died less than an hour before that fateful day of November 22, 1963, commenced at midnight.\n\nNOTE: While this story is a work of fiction, much of it is taken from a little known occurrence in Oklahoma City.
