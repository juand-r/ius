      "content": "It's a fun day -- Easter Sunday.\nMary loved to greet that one day! In the sunshine, she felt happy\nand her bright new shoes looked snappy. For her church she'd proudly dressed.\nBut before, she'd made a quest, peeking on the park beside,\nwhere those Easter eggs would hide -- Eggs and candies, flowers too.\nThings to eat and things that grew! After church (and wooden seats),\nin that park she'd hunt for treats! But a mystery, without warning,\nlurked outside on Easter morning. And a special Easter game.\nFind the guilty bunny's name! After all the eggs were hid, \nMary wondered what they did? Someone hid them -- then was gone --\nleaving presents on the lawn. \"Where'd that Easter Bunny go?\"\nMary felt she had to know. Past the park, where lilies grew,\nthere's a stream that trickles through. Past its bridge, across a field\nblooming flowers were revealed. Mary spotted luscious hills,\nshining bright with daffodils, \"Maybe if I'm not a dum-dum\nI'll learn where these lilies come from!\" But instead, the meadow air\nseemed to glow a magic glare. On the grass, below her legs -- \nshone a thousand Easter eggs! And the eggs were just a fraction\nof the crazy Easter action. There, to practice hiding habits,\nMary saw a thousand rabbits! \"Hey, who's that?\" a bunny shouted.\n\"We've been spotted! We've been outted!\" Then one thousand bunnies turned,\ncurious what Mary learned. \"Look at her! She's found the clues.\"\n\"And she's wearing pretty shoes.\" In the flowers, bunnies rose\nwiggling each pinkish nose. White fur, brown fur -- some were grey.\nThey were everywhere today! \"See these eggs that we'll be sharing?\nHiding them takes some preparing!\" said the smartest bunny rabbit.\nHe's the boss. His name is Abbot. \"Hiding well takes several tries.\nSo I teach -- I supervise!\" \"He's just lazy,\" joked another.\nIt was Randy -- Abbot's brother. Randy's grey, with silver legs.\nHe hid only dark grey eggs. He'd make jokes both dark and funny,\nlike a wise-guy Easter bunny! And when Abbot tried to preach,\nRandy found new things to teach. \"Randy, it's important we \nhide our treasures carefully.\" \"Lazy -- that's what's wrong with him.\nAbbot needs to hit the gym!\" Mary laughed, but suddenly\none bright flash whizzed instantly! Breezes brushed across her face.\nlike a rabbit in a race. \"I'm Speedy,\" the bunny said\n(Cloud-white fur and eyes of red). \"It takes work to hide those eggs\nso I exercise my legs!\" Abbot said, \"His pride's quite clear.\nHe's the fastest bunny here!\" Randy laid down six bright eggs.\nSpeedy crouched down on his legs. \"Watch him now. Each egg he budges.\nHe'll roll it with careful nudges.\" Speedy stared, as though deciding \nwhere the eggs should all be hiding. Then he yelled, \"It' so much fun.\nCount me down now. 3, 2, 1\" Poof! He vanished! Blurs of white!\nEvery egg rolled out of sight! There was grass now, nothing more.\nWhere the eggs had been before. \"Presto!\" Speedy yelled to Randy.\n\"Find them, and I'll give you candy!\" Randy grumbled, then said, \"Speedy,\nFor your candy, I'll be greedy.\" In a hole he disappeared.\nBut TWO Randys re-appeared. \"Look,\" said Randy, \"Ain't this handy?\nThis is my twin brother, Andy!\" More bad jokes, and grey fur too!\"\n\"He's like Randy. Now there's two!\" Abbot muttered, \"What a psyche.\nEverything they do alike -- Walking, talking, hiding eggs.\nAnd they both have silver legs!\" Twitching whiskers soon detected.\nFrom their hole, the two ejected, Two grey bunnies raced around\nhelping Speedy's eggs get found. But then Mary had a thought\nsomething big that she'd forgot. \"Whoops! It's Sunday. Time for church!\"\n\"Hey! Don't leave us in a lurch!\" Bunny friends all gathered round her\nSaying they were glad they'd found her. Giving her an Easter cheer, \nPromising they'd meet next year. \"Could I have a souvenir\nTo remember I've been here?\" Mary knew she had to ask it \nEying Randy's Easter basket. \"Randy is so good at finding.\nJust one egg could be reminding!\" Abbot shook his ears and said,\n\"I give flowers out instead. \"All these eggs are spoken for.\nJust for Easter. Not one more.\" Mary left their Easter-land,\nWith a lily in her hand. Empty pockets (just her keys),\nbut she still could feel at ease. Sunshine left a gentle spark \nas she strolled back towards the park. Easter morning always pleases.\nOnce she even felt some breezes. But in church this day would seem,\nas though it had been a dream. But the bunnies that she treasured\nKnew that they would be remembered. As she reached down towards her leg, \nnow her pocket held an egg! Mary didn't trust her eyes\nShe had found a big surprise. It was blue and yellow too\nJust as though its dye was new. She was touched. They didn't ignore her!\nWho had left that egg there for her? Play this special Easter game.\nFind the guilty bunny's name!",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.   Identify the “crime”  \n     • Not a crime in the criminal sense – simply “Who slipped a blue-and-yellow Easter egg into Mary’s pocket without her noticing?”  \n2.   List every rabbit present  \n     • Abbot (white, the boss)  \n     • Randy (grey, silver-legged, dark-humoured)  \n     • Andy (Randy’s identical twin)  \n     • Speedy (white, red-eyed, blindingly fast)\n\n3.   Examine each rabbit’s motive, opportunity, and constraints  \n\n     Abbot  \n       – Motive: None. He explicitly claims every egg is pre-assigned and forbids extras.  \n       – Opportunity: He was standing next to Mary, but doing so would contradict his own rule, and Mary would probably have noticed his much slower movement.  \n       – Physical evidence / alibi: Gave her only a lily, consistent with his statement.\n\n     Randy  \n       – Motive: None. He hides only dark grey eggs; Mary’s souvenir is blue and yellow.  \n       – Opportunity: Possibly, but the colour mismatch exposes him.  \n       – Alibi / evidence: Constant joking and digging with Andy; no indication he ever strayed near Mary after she left.\n\n     Andy  \n       – Same constraints and tastes as Randy. If Randy won’t use coloured eggs, neither will Andy.\n\n     Speedy  \n       – Motive: Loves to show off, loves practical jokes (“Find them, and I’ll give you candy!”). Giving Mary a surprise egg fits his playful nature.  \n       – Opportunity: His speed allows him to reach Mary after she departs, slip an egg into a pocket, and retreat without being seen.  \n       – Physical evidence: Mary felt a breeze while walking back to the park – the very sensation described whenever Speedy moves (“Breezes brushed across her face… like a rabbit in a race.”)\n\n4.   Deductive climax offered by the author  \n     The poem itself walks the reader through the clues Mary uses:  \n     • Abbot’s declaration that no extra eggs will be given.  \n     • Randy & Andy’s monochrome egg preference.  \n     • The pocket was empty until “breezes” (i.e., Speedy) shot past.  \n     Ergo the only plausible agent is Speedy.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAbbot, Randy, Andy, Speedy\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nSpeedy (alias “Speedy the Easter Bunny”)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter hiding practice, the rabbits bid Mary farewell.  \n1. Abbot hands Mary a single lily, honoring his rule that no spare eggs be given away.  \n2. Mary sets off toward the park, pockets empty except for her keys.  \n3. Speedy, eager to give the human child a parting thrill, snatches a freshly dyed blue-and-yellow egg (not one of Randy’s dark-grey stock) and dashes after her.  \n4. Approaching from behind, he uses his trademark blur-of-white speed, generating a cool breeze that Mary vaguely notices.  \n5. In a split second he slips the egg into Mary’s pocket and is gone before she can turn.  \n6. Mary walks on, later discovers the stowaway egg inside her pocket, and reconstructs exactly what happened.\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nAbbot – His own rule forbidding any “extra” eggs would be contradicted; instead he openly presented Mary with a flower. Slow, visible movements make a secret plant impossible.\n\nRandy – Limits himself to dark-grey eggs, so he would not select a bright blue-and-yellow one. He stayed occupied searching for Speedy’s hidden eggs with Andy.\n\nAndy – Identical habits and egg colour preferences to Randy; always seen together with his twin during the relevant period.\n\nOnly Speedy possesses both the inclination (mischievous generosity) and the physical ability (blinding speed causing noticeable breezes) to carry out the surreptitious delivery. Hence all others are cleared, and Speedy is definitively the “guilty” bunny.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
