      "content": "Karen Sheldon had loved Easter egg hunts ever since she was a little girl. That is why she eagerly volunteered to assist with this year’s Hunt for the children at her church. This year, the Children’s Day Out mothers decided to do something different. Because there were so many children of all ages in the congregation, they split the hunt up into age groups. Karen’s job was to oversee several of the 6-10 year olds. Within her group were five children she knew well. They were Rachel Smithson, whose mother Karla had volunteered to help a very grateful Karen, Justin Bates, a classmate of Rachel’s, Karen’s daughter Lizzie, Lizzie’s best friend Anna Laughlin and Cole Bryant, who was also the Sheldon’s next door neighbor. The Easter egg hunt was on Saturday morning, the day before Easter Sunday. It was held in the large field in back of the church. Karen and Karla were grateful that today was sunny and warm although it was a bit windy. Karen was excited as the children prepared for the hunt, which was to begin at 10:00 am and last for one hour. Just before the start whistle blew, Karen told the children, “I have placed a golden Easter egg in our hunting area. There is an extra bag of candy for the child who finds it.” Only Karla and she knew that the golden egg was placed in back of the largest tree in the field, an old oak in the far corner to the left of where she and the children now stood and an area dedicated to the 6-10 year old age group. During the hunt, Karen and Karla visited while they watched the egg hunt. During the hunt, Karen noticed that Cole stayed focused on the evergreen shrubbery in the middle of the field, finding several eggs there, much to his delight. Karen was amused when Rachel ran to her mother and told her, “I have found a lot of eggs. I’m heading back to the rock pile. I bet I will find the golden egg there!” The rock pile was to the right of the evergreen shrubbery. In the middle of the hunt, Karen excused herself to go inside the church to get a drink of water and sit for a few minutes. When she returned, Karla told her, “I had to run over and warn Lizzie to be careful of the dead branches on the big oak tree. One of them fell last week, hitting one of the older kids.” As the hunt began to wind down, Karla walked out to speak with a very agitated Anna. After returning to Karen, she told her, “Anna is upset because she has found only a few eggs. I told her to keep looking; there are still a few minutes to go.” Karen noticed that Anna stayed close to Karla for the remainder of the hunt. As the whistle blew to end the hunt, Karen walked to the center of the field to wave Justin back in. He was in the far right corner of the field, where he had been for the entire hunt. There was a sand pit in that area and Justin found several eggs there. As the kids headed back to the start area, Karen once again excused herself to go inside. The wind had blown a speck of dust in her eye when waving Justin down and it was very painful. When she returned from rinsing her eyes, Karla and the five children were smiling at her. She asked, “What’s up?” Karla answered, “One of our kids found the golden egg. We want you to guess which one.” Karen smiled in return, saying, “So that’s it!” Thinking for a moment, she said, “I only have one question. When I was inside the first time, did any of the children move from one side of the field to another?” Karla answered, “No.” Karen tousled Justin’s hair and said, “Good. Then I know who has the golden egg!”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Location of the golden egg  \n   • Only Karen and Karla know that it was hidden behind the old oak in the far-left corner of the 6-to-10 area.  \n2. Where every child spent the hour  \n   • Cole – in the evergreen shrubbery in the middle of the field.  \n   • Rachel – in and around the rock pile to the right of the shrubbery.  \n   • Justin – the sand pit in the far-right corner of the field (so far away he could not even hear the whistle).  \n   • Anna – near Karla during the last several minutes and never near the oak.  \n   • Lizzie – the only child seen at the oak; Karla actually walked over to warn her about falling branches.  \n3. The critical question Karen asks Karla  \n   • “While I was inside, did any of the children move from one side of the field to another?”  \n   • Karla answers “No,” which freezes every child’s position for the whole hunt.  \n4. Opportunity analysis  \n   • The egg could only be reached by the child who spent time at the oak.  \n   • Only Lizzie fulfills that condition.  \n5. Motive  \n   • All of the children wanted extra candy. No darker motive exists; the “crime” is simply finding the prize.  \n6. Physical evidence / alibis  \n   • Each child’s location is an alibi that rules them out—except Lizzie.  \n7. Logical deduction  \n   • If nobody changed sides of the field, the golden egg never left the oak area.  \n   • Therefore whoever was at the oak must have it.  \n   • Hence the golden egg-finder (the “culprit”) is Lizzie Sheldon.  \n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nLizzie Sheldon, Cole Bryant, Rachel Smithson, Justin Bates, Anna Laughlin\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLizzie Sheldon\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nEarly that morning Karen Sheldon hid a single golden Easter egg behind the old oak tree.  \nAt 10:00 a.m. the hunt began.  \n• Cole combed the evergreen shrubbery in mid-field.  \n• Rachel circled the rock pile to the right.  \n• Justin dug through the sand pit in the far-right corner.  \n• Anna wandered but, near the end, stayed beside Karla in the center of the field.  \n• Lizzie worked the ground around the oak. When Karla came over to warn her about falling branches, Lizzie found the golden egg, slipped it into her basket, and continued hunting ordinary eggs.  \nBecause no child ever shifted zones, the egg could not have been picked up by anyone else.  \nAt the end Karen re-entered the field; the children challenged her to guess the winner. Knowing positions had not changed, she deduced that her own daughter, Lizzie, was the only possible finder.  \nLizzie then good-naturedly handed the golden egg to her disappointed friend Anna.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Cole Bryant – Spent the whole hour in the shrubbery, a long way from the oak; never approached the hiding spot.  \n• Rachel Smithson – Hunted exclusively around the rock pile, even farther from the oak.  \n• Justin Bates – Remained in the sand pit in the extreme right corner and had to be summoned back; impossible for him to have reached the oak without being seen.  \n• Anna Laughlin – Was still looking for ordinary eggs with only minutes left and then stood beside Karla until the whistle; she never went near the oak tree.  \nTherefore none of them could have obtained the golden egg; only Lizzie Sheldon had the opportunity and thus is conclusively the finder—i.e., the “culprit.”\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
