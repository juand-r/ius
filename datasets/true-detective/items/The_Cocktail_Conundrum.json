      "content": "The exclusive cocktail party, hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Fairbank, had prematurely ended with the untimely demise of one of the guests, not to mention Mrs. Fairbank’s social reputation. The victim, Mrs. Maisy Rhys, tested positive for cyanide poisoning. Her death must have been instantaneous, which left no doubt that she had been poisoned at the party. There was nothing to indicate a suicide. On the contrary, Mrs. Rhys had been excited about an upcoming holiday to Africa where she was planning to begin charitable work. No, Inspector Simmons was sure this was not a suicide. The dead woman had also left a will naming each of the other guests as a beneficiary, a strong motive for murder in the inspector’s opinion. Inspector Simmons stepped lightly across the plush carpet and surveyed the room. There were only three suspects waiting to be interviewed, while his report had stated that he was to expect four. A tall, blonde woman walked briskly over and shook the inspector by the hand. “Good evening, I’m Mrs. Fairbank, I do hope we can resolve this quickly, having police here will look terribly bad.” “We seem to be one person short,” the inspector said as he looked briefly around the fashionable living room. “Oh, my husband is unconscious in his chair,” Mrs. Fairbank replied with an indifferent tone. As he looked over the arm of a recliner, Inspector Simmons noticed a corpulent, middle-aged man sleeping soundly, apparently unaware of the grave events that had taken place in his home. “Could you wake your husband up for me please, madam?” “Must I? He’s such a dreadful nuisance unless he’s asleep,” Mrs Fairbank said. “Regrettably madam, it will be necessary,” the inspector replied. Mrs. Fairbank gave her husband an unceremonious kick. After a series of grunts and some mumbled complaints about a headache, the man managed to focus on the inspector. “Heavy night was it, Mr. Fairbank?” “Cocktail party,” Fairbank grumbled. “It might interest you to know that one of your guests is dead.” “Can’t you get my wife to sort it out?” “I’d like you to answer a couple of questions for me, Mr. Fairbank. How many people were here this evening?” “Me, my wife, our son, Mr. Rhys and Mrs. Rhys. Can I go back to sleep now?” “Sir, there’s been a murder!” The inspector cried in exasperation. “Well I’d best let you get on with it then,” Mr Fairbank said as he promptly dropped back off to sleep. Inspector Simmons was tempted to wake Mr. Fairbank up to charge him with aggravating a detective, but his attention came to rest upon a collection of bottles gathered on the central, glass living table. “Were the contents of these bottles all that was consumed at the party?” Simmons asked. “That’s correct,” Mrs. Fairbank replied, “I prepared food as well, but my husband managed to demolish all of that before the guests even arrived.” “Who opened these bottles in preparation for the guests arriving?” “My husband did. He was supposed to be in charge of dispensing the drinks but he just opened all the bottles, helped himself to a drink from each one and then fell asleep.” “Who poured drinks during the party?” “We all helped ourselves before we sat down, no one here is a heavy drinker and we were only on our first round when the tragedy occurred.” “I see,” said the inspector. Inspector Simmons looked around the living room, there were two cocktail glasses side by side on the central table, one on a small table next to a leather armchair and one balanced on the window sill next to an ornate wicker chair. All of the glasses contained a green liquid residue, except for the one by the leather armchair, which had a small amount of creamy white mixture in the bottom. “Who drank from this glass?” Simmons asked as he pointed to the odd one out. “That was mine,” Mr. Rhys said shakily, “the others drank grasshoppers, but I prefer White Russians.” “Ah, so Mr. and Mrs. Fairbank and the victim were all drinking grasshoppers?” “Yes, that’s right,” Mr. Rhys replied, as he looked around the room. Inspector Simmons looked at the two glasses that stood next to each other on the central table. One glass was nearly empty and the other was very nearly full. “Two people must have sat next to each other on the sofa.” “That was me and Maisy,” Ian Fairbank explained. “Which was your glass?” Inspector Simmons asked. “This one,” Ian said as he pointed to the glass that was very nearly empty. The Inspector looked over to the glass that was placed on the window ledge and noted that it was filled almost to the brim. Tucked behind the glass was a small ashtray. “So Mrs. Fairbank, you sat in the wicker chair?” the inspector asked. Mrs. Fairbank nodded briskly in answer. “Quite an ashtray this one is,” the inspector commented as he walked briskly to the central table and scooped up a large metal receptacle that had been sitting just in front of Maisy’s glass. In the ornate ashtray were six cigarette butts. “Yes, I like unusual ornaments,” Mrs. Fairbank said. “Let me see, six cigarette ends are in here. Five Camels and one Marlboro.” “The Camels were Maisy’s,” Ian said, “she was trying to quit, quite ironic really if you think about it.” “Whose is the Marlboro?” Inspector Simmons asked. “That was me, I like the occasional smoke,” Mrs. Fairbank said. “You should try and give up if you can, it’s very bad for you,” Inspector Simmons said with a smile.",

He could easily have poisoned one and made sure that he gave Maisy a drink from that particular bottle. However, Mr. Fairbank drank from all of the bottles himself and then fell asleep.

However, note that the levels in the two glasses are very different. Mrs. Rhys would have noticed if her almost empty glass was suddenly full. Of course you, Mrs. Fairbank, were also drinking a grasshopper and the level of your glass is almost exactly the same as that of this drink here in Maisy’s place.”\n“But I wasn’t sitting anywhere near Maisy! How could I have swapped drinks with her from across the room?” Mrs. Fairbank cried.\n“Oh, but you made sure you came close enough to do it,” Inspector Simmons said quietly, “you got up to put your cigarette out in the ashtray near Maisy when you could much more easily have put it out in the one that was right next to your chair. You see Mrs. Fairbank, I’ve always maintained that smoking is a very dangerous habit.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. List the facts that cannot be disputed  \n   •  Cyanide killed Mrs Maisy Rhys instantly, so the poison was delivered during the party.  \n   •  Mr Fairbank uncorked every bottle, sampled each, then fell asleep – he is still alive, therefore no bottle contained cyanide.  \n   •  Each guest poured his / her own cocktail from the same bottles, so the only place the poison could be was in ONE individual glass.  \n   •  All four surviving guests therefore had only one possible method: poison his / her own drink and swap it with Maisy’s.\n\n2. Exclude suspects who could not have swapped drinks without being noticed  \n   •  Mr Rhys was drinking a WHITE RUSSIAN (creamy-white); Maisy and the Fairbanks were drinking GRASSHOPPERS (green).  \n     – A change of colour would have been obvious, so Mr Rhys could not have swapped.  \n   •  This leaves Mrs Fairbank and Ian Fairbank.\n\n3. Compare the two grasshopper glasses that stood together on the sofa table  \n   •  Ian sat beside Maisy.  \n   •  Ian’s glass is “very nearly empty”; the glass in Maisy’s place is “very nearly full”.  \n   •  Had Ian poisoned his own almost-empty glass and exchanged it, Maisy would suddenly be holding a nearly-empty one – she would have noticed.  \n   •  Therefore Ian did not switch glasses.\n\n4. Examine Mrs Fairbank’s movements and the physical evidence  \n   •  Mrs Fairbank’s seat (the wicker chair by the window) already had a small ashtray.  \n   •  Nevertheless one MARLBORO butt – Mrs Fairbank’s brand – is found in the large ashtray directly in front of Maisy.  \n   •  To put that cigarette out Mrs Fairbank had to stand up, walk to Maisy’s table, lean over the drinks – the perfect moment to swap two almost-full, identical-looking green cocktails.  \n   •  Levels match: the glass on the window-sill (Mrs Fairbank’s place) is “filled almost to the brim”, practically the same as the one left in front of Maisy.  \n   •  This shows she never really drank from her own cocktail; she had prepared it only as a poisoned decoy to be left with Maisy.\n\n5. Motive  \n   •  Like all the others, she was a beneficiary of the will.  \n   •  In addition Mrs Fairbank’s snobbish concern for her “social reputation” hints at friction with the heavy-smoking Maisy, but motive is secondary – the opportunity and evidence are conclusive.\n\n6. Logical conclusion  \n   •  Only Mrs Fairbank had the brand-specific trace (the Marlboro) that places her right at the victim’s glass after the drinks were poured, and only she could swap two glasses whose contents looked and were filled alike.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nMr. Charles Fairbank, Mrs. Eleanor Fairbank, Ian Fairbank, Mr. Harold Rhys\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nMrs. Eleanor Fairbank\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n• Before the guests arrived Charles Fairbank uncorked every bottle, tasted from each, then passed out in a chair.  \n• When the guests mixed their first round of cocktails Eleanor Fairbank quietly laced her own grasshopper with cyanide but did not drink it.  \n• Everyone sat: Eleanor in the wicker chair by the window, Maisy and Ian on the sofa, Harold Rhys in the leather arm-chair.  \n• Eleanor lit a Marlboro cigarette.  \n• Wanting to get close to Maisy without arousing suspicion, she crossed the room under the pretext of using the large, “unusual” ashtray on the coffee-table in front of Maisy, although a perfectly good ashtray sat beside her own chair.  \n• While stubbing out her cigarette she casually exchanged her still-full, poisoned grasshopper for Maisy’s still-full, untainted one.  \n• She carried Maisy’s harmless drink back to the wicker chair and set it on the window-sill; it therefore remains almost brimming.  \n• Maisy took a sip of the poisoned grasshopper and died almost instantly of cyanide poisoning.  \n• The level differences of the other drinks and the lone Marlboro butt in the ornate ashtray point straight to Eleanor’s manoeuvre.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mr. Charles Fairbank – He never left his chair after falling asleep. Because he tasted every bottle and lived, the poison was not in the bottles. No chance to tamper with glasses afterward.  \n• Ian Fairbank – His own glass was nearly empty whereas Maisy’s was nearly full; a swap between those two would have left Maisy holding a nearly-empty glass, something she would have noticed.  \n• Mr. Harold Rhys – He drank a white Russian, completely different in colour and texture from the green grasshopper. Any attempt to swap would have been obvious at a glance.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

He could easily have poisoned one and made sure that he gave Maisy a drink from that particular bottle. However, Mr. Fairbank drank from all of the bottles himself and then fell asleep. And since he is still alive, we can safely say that the poison was not in the bottles.”\nThe inspector began pacing the room. “This means that the poison had to have been in this drink,” Inspector Simmons said as he pointed to Maisy’s glass, “you each got your own drinks and since I’m certain that this was no suicide it’s clear to me that one of you must have put the poison in your own drink and then swapped glasses with Maisy.”\n“Who would do such a thing! Mrs. Fairbank gasped.\n“Mr. Rhys was drinking a different cocktail than his wife, so that rules him out, because his wife would have noticed the change. That leaves me with you, Mrs Fairbank, and your son, Ian.”\n“My son would never do such a thing!” Mrs. Fairbank shot back.\n“Ian sat next to Maisy on the sofa, and would have had the opportunity to switch drinks with her. However, note that the levels in the two glasses are very different. Mrs. Rhys would have noticed if her almost empty glass was suddenly full. Of course you, Mrs. Fairbank, were also drinking a grasshopper and the level of your glass is almost exactly the same as that of this drink here in Maisy’s place.”\n“But I wasn’t sitting anywhere near Maisy! How could I have swapped drinks with her from across the room?” Mrs. Fairbank cried.\n“Oh, but you made sure you came close enough to do it,” Inspector Simmons said quietly, “you got up to put your cigarette out in the ashtray near Maisy when you could much more easily have put it out in the one that was right next to your chair. You see Mrs. Fairbank, I’ve always maintained that smoking is a very dangerous habit.”"
