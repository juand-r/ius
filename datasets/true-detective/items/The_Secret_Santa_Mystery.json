      "content": "Reverend Dan Parsons had to admit to some human pride whenever he thought of the church he had built. Now in its sixth year, what had started as a handful of people in his living room had grown into a membership of over 600 faithful. What impressed and pleased him the most, as he sat sipping a cup of coffee in his modest office one afternoon shortly after Thanksgiving, was that the membership was an excellent mixture of the young and old. There were many young couples with children of all ages but also a solid group of senior citizens to go along with the many middle-aged persons in his congregation. His attention now turned to Christmas and the decorating of the church. The “Hanging of the Greens” in the sanctuary was one of the best times of the year for Pastor Dan, for it commenced the Season of Advent. It was his favorite time in the Christian year. A tradition, which he had started in the young church’s first year, was the Christmas tree in the sanctuary. This year, the new sanctuary had been completed and there would be ample room for a large tree and the gifts to God, which the membership would place beneath it. These gifts would be distributed to the various local charitable organizations shortly before Christmas Day. Pastor Dan was very pleased that this had quickly become a tradition at the young church. The people in his flock were kind, generous and not forgetful of the disadvantaged persons living in the community. All of this was running through his mind as he walked to the sanctuary to examine the tree, which had been placed a week ago. What he found underneath it surprised him, for not only did he find the first few gifts to the hungry and homeless people, but also there were several brightly colored gift-wrapped boxes addressed to various children of the church. They were simply marked as being, “From Santa.” Pastor Dan did not think anything of this at first, but the next day he noticed several more gifts. They were similarly wrapped and again addressed to individual children of the church “From Santa.” Bright sunlight coming through the new sanctuary window bathed the beautifully decorated tree. At this moment, Pastor Dan realized that the tree was blessed by God and a Secret Santa Claus was leaving gifts for the church children beneath it. He smiled and wondered who in his congregation was performing good works in secret. Back in his office, with afternoon coffee firmly in hand, Pastor Dan paused to reflect. Security was tight in the new church and besides staff members there were only a handful of persons with keys to the main building, which housed the sanctuary. After finishing his coffee, Dan could only think of five parishioners who could be Secret Santa. Three of them chaired key committees and the other two were members of the building committee. They just happened to be all men, men of all ages. Pastor Dan realized that “Santa Claus” could very easily be a staff member and/or a female. But, his years as an ordained minister had placed within him a keen intuition and sixth sense regarding church business and spiritual matters. He had a hunch that “Santa” was one of the five non-staff church members with keys to the main building. Dan thought no more about this for the remainder of the day, for his afternoon and evening were busy with committee meetings plus the death of one of the elder church member’s sister. Around 10:00 p.m., Dan sat in his office, which was only a few feet down the hall from the entrance to the sanctuary and quietly sipped a diet drink. He was grateful the long day was over. He knew he would have another one tomorrow. The door his office was closed and his light was off. He loved the feeling of peace and spirituality the quiet office offered under such circumstances. As he sat in silence, alone with his thoughts, he heard noises in the sanctuary. Immediately he suspected that Santa Claus was making a delivery. He was alone in the darkened, closed pastor’s office, and his car was parked around in back. Santa no doubt came in the front entrance, believing the building was empty. Acting quickly, Dan silently crept to the sanctuary door, peeking in to see what was happening. What he saw startled him in a way he had never experienced before -- and in his time in ministry he had seen much. He saw a man dressed as Santa placing gifts underneath the big tree. The man moved quickly and, when he arose, Dan noticed he was not pudgy like the real Santa Claus at all, but rather he was slender and very graceful. He had to move very quickly and as silently as Santa did to make it back to his office before being seen. Dan’s curiosity now got the better of him. He knew he would not rest until he got to the bottom of this. He planned to be secretly in the building every night for the remainder of the week. He hoped Santa had not finished his work. Dan strongly suspected he had not. The next night, Pastor Dan took extra precautions, returning to the church around 9:30 p.m. and leaving his automobile parked around the block. A little after 10:00, he was rewarded for his diligence. This time, he heard “Santa” quietly enter the main building at the front door. He did not leave his office until he was certain Santa was in the sanctuary. He got to the door in time to see Santa hurry toward the tree carrying a huge sack. It was obviously heavy as Dan noticed Santa used both hands to tote it. Santa again laid the gifts underneath the tree quickly. This time, Dan knew Santa would hurry out of the sanctuary to exit the building so he returned to his office as Santa placed the last gift at the foot of the tree. Dan spent most of the next day thinking of Secret Santa. Who could it be? Dan did not know it yet but he would get his answer later that night. The scenario was the same as it had been the previous two nights. Dan observed Santa quickly and silently entering the church building to place Christmas gifts underneath the tree for the children of the church. As Dan, for the third night in a row, spied on Santa from outside the sanctuary, he recalled with amusement receiving the first telephone call about the gifts underneath the tree from a curious parishioner late that morning. He told the caller that there was a Secret Santa Claus in the congregation but had no idea who he really was. Dan noticed that Santa reached into the sack of gifts with his left hand. Quickly and efficiently, as in the two nights previously, he was very graceful in his movements and wasted no time or effort. Dan thought to himself that this was no doubt how the real Santa Claus worked. How could it be otherwise if he wanted to visit all the homes of small children the world over in one night? Dan quietly trekked the few feet back to his office. Sitting silently as Santa quickly locked the front door and drove away, he thought seriously about the identity of his congregations’ Santa Claus. Very soon, more parishioners would be asking questions about Santa Claus and the presents underneath the tree. Pastor Dan thought of the five men who possessed keys to the main building. First on his mind was Al Busby. Al chaired the Church Council and was the oldest of the group at 77. He was a wonderful man but suffered from arthritic knees and walked with a cane. Next, he considered Chuck Daughtry. Chuck was the youngest of the men at age 33 and a member of the building committee. He was also a member of the church’s newly formed basketball team and the first to suffer injury in a game, badly breaking an arm a couple of weeks ago. Dan’s thoughts turned to Jim Dockery. Jim was 45 years old and a former professional baseball player. Jim was the Pastor-Parish Relations committee chair and, as such, Dan knew him well. He recalled fondly the last time they had dined together, discussing church business and swapping stories. He learned that Jim used to pitch for a Triple-A minor league team and was the first left-handed pitcher on that team to throw a no-hitter. He was very proud of that and Dan was a man who had much to be proud of, for Dan had grown wealthy with the computer company he had founded 15 years ago. Pastor Dan was deep in thought. But, he laughed out loud as he considered Bob Key as Santa Claus. Bobby, as he was called, was 65 years old and one of the most lovable men in the church. If anyone could be Santa Claus, it would be Bobby. However, Dan’s amusement turned to somberness as he recalled Bobby’s clumsiness. Last year, he broke a leg falling down stairs and, just recently, broke a lamp in Dan’s office during a meeting of the building committee. Finally, he thought of Jeff Reynolds. Jeff’s story was a sad one. Jeff was 41 years old but had suffered a minor stroke last year. He had lost his job stacking freight in a warehouse because he walked with a limp and had lost strength on his right side. But, his fate could have been far worse. He was the best committee worker of the five and had lost none of his organizational and administrative skills. Jeff and his family considered him very fortunate. Could a grateful Jeff Reynolds be “Secret Santa?” Sipping a cold diet cola, Dan sat in thoughtful silence until almost midnight. Then it came to him and he wondered why it took him so long to figure it out. Before locking up, a very relieved Pastor Dan called his wife to tell her he was coming home. Before hanging up, he said, “and I know who our Secret Santa is.”",

Dan then asked him to come to his office for a visit. Santa complied and they met shortly after lunch.\nSanta wasted no time. Before even sitting down, he asked Dan, “How did you know it was me? I’m a little disturbed, for you know we are to do our good works in secret.”\nDan smiled and said, “Don’t worry. You’re secret is safe with me. Let me explain and then we’ll discuss how to proceed. I like what you are doing and the Santa suit is a nice touch.”\nJim said, “That’s just in case somebody like you happens to see me.”\nAfter a short pause, Dan continued, “You didn’t know it, but I watched you the last three nights. I know there are only five non-staff church members with keys to the building. My instincts told me it was not a staff member. So, it had to be one of five people – all men, as it turns out”\nSmiling, Santa said, “Your instincts did not lie to you.”\nSmiling back, Dan said, “I’m pleased you are feeling a bit better about being found out. So, how did I figure it out? Well, mainly by simple pastoral observation. I noticed early on that you walked quickly. Certainly Al Busby, 77 years old and crippled by arthritis, could not do that. I also saw that you carried the heavy sack with both hands. That counts Al Daughtry out. You know he has a badly broken arm.”\nDan paused a moment and both men chuckled. Santa asked, “That’s two down and good observations, Dan.”\nDan smiled and said. “Thanks. Now, I also noticed over the course of the last three evenings that you moved with a great deal of quickness and grace. You know how clumsy Bobby Key is. He would not be capable of doing what you did. So, that takes me next to Jeff Reynolds. As you know, his stroke last year has made him weak on his right side and walking with a limp. He, too, would not be able to move as quickly and efficiently as Secret Santa.”\nJim Dockery was now smiling broadly, for he had grown comfortable with Pastor Dan knowing his secret. He asked, “So, do you have a clue for me or was it just process of elimination?”\nDan replied, “It could have been process of elimination, but I saw you reach into Santa’s sack with your left hand.”\n“So what?” asked Jim, not yet understanding the significance?\n“So, you told me at our last lunch together that you were the first left-handed pitcher on your minor league baseball team to throw a no-hitter!”\nBoth men laughed. Pastor Dan took Jim Dockery’s hand in fellowship and friendship and asked, “So, how may I help?”\nJim replied, “Just tell those who ask that you have no idea who Secret Santa is. Allow me to do this work in secret so that the light may shine upon Jesus Christ. He is the true giver of gifts.”",

Please read the story carefully before you decide who the culprit is.\n\n\nReverend Dan Parsons had to admit to some human pride whenever he thought of the church he had built. Now in its sixth year, what had started as a handful of people in his living room had grown into a membership of over 600 faithful. What impressed and pleased him the most, as he sat sipping a cup of coffee in his modest office one afternoon shortly after Thanksgiving, was that the membership was an excellent mixture of the young and old. There were many young couples with children of all ages but also a solid group of senior citizens to go along with the many middle-aged persons in his congregation. His attention now turned to Christmas and the decorating of the church. The “Hanging of the Greens” in the sanctuary was one of the best times of the year for Pastor Dan, for it commenced the Season of Advent. It was his favorite time in the Christian year. A tradition, which he had started in the young church’s first year, was the Christmas tree in the sanctuary. This year, the new sanctuary had been completed and there would be ample room for a large tree and the gifts to God, which the membership would place beneath it. These gifts would be distributed to the various local charitable organizations shortly before Christmas Day. Pastor Dan was very pleased that this had quickly become a tradition at the young church. The people in his flock were kind, generous and not forgetful of the disadvantaged persons living in the community. All of this was running through his mind as he walked to the sanctuary to examine the tree, which had been placed a week ago. What he found underneath it surprised him, for not only did he find the first few gifts to the hungry and homeless people, but also there were several brightly colored gift-wrapped boxes addressed to various children of the church. They were simply marked as being, “From Santa.” Pastor Dan did not think anything of this at first, but the next day he noticed several more gifts. They were similarly wrapped and again addressed to individual children of the church “From Santa.” Bright sunlight coming through the new sanctuary window bathed the beautifully decorated tree. At this moment, Pastor Dan realized that the tree was blessed by God and a Secret Santa Claus was leaving gifts for the church children beneath it. He smiled and wondered who in his congregation was performing good works in secret. Back in his office, with afternoon coffee firmly in hand, Pastor Dan paused to reflect. Security was tight in the new church and besides staff members there were only a handful of persons with keys to the main building, which housed the sanctuary. After finishing his coffee, Dan could only think of five parishioners who could be Secret Santa. Three of them chaired key committees and the other two were members of the building committee. They just happened to be all men, men of all ages. Pastor Dan realized that “Santa Claus” could very easily be a staff member and/or a female. But, his years as an ordained minister had placed within him a keen intuition and sixth sense regarding church business and spiritual matters. He had a hunch that “Santa” was one of the five non-staff church members with keys to the main building. Dan thought no more about this for the remainder of the day, for his afternoon and evening were busy with committee meetings plus the death of one of the elder church member’s sister. Around 10:00 p.m., Dan sat in his office, which was only a few feet down the hall from the entrance to the sanctuary and quietly sipped a diet drink. He was grateful the long day was over. He knew he would have another one tomorrow. The door his office was closed and his light was off. He loved the feeling of peace and spirituality the quiet office offered under such circumstances. As he sat in silence, alone with his thoughts, he heard noises in the sanctuary. Immediately he suspected that Santa Claus was making a delivery. He was alone in the darkened, closed pastor’s office, and his car was parked around in back. Santa no doubt came in the front entrance, believing the building was empty. Acting quickly, Dan silently crept to the sanctuary door, peeking in to see what was happening. What he saw startled him in a way he had never experienced before -- and in his time in ministry he had seen much. He saw a man dressed as Santa placing gifts underneath the big tree. The man moved quickly and, when he arose, Dan noticed he was not pudgy like the real Santa Claus at all, but rather he was slender and very graceful. He had to move very quickly and as silently as Santa did to make it back to his office before being seen. Dan’s curiosity now got the better of him. He knew he would not rest until he got to the bottom of this. He planned to be secretly in the building every night for the remainder of the week. He hoped Santa had not finished his work. Dan strongly suspected he had not. The next night, Pastor Dan took extra precautions, returning to the church around 9:30 p.m. and leaving his automobile parked around the block. A little after 10:00, he was rewarded for his diligence. This time, he heard “Santa” quietly enter the main building at the front door. He did not leave his office until he was certain Santa was in the sanctuary. He got to the door in time to see Santa hurry toward the tree carrying a huge sack. It was obviously heavy as Dan noticed Santa used both hands to tote it. Santa again laid the gifts underneath the tree quickly. This time, Dan knew Santa would hurry out of the sanctuary to exit the building so he returned to his office as Santa placed the last gift at the foot of the tree. Dan spent most of the next day thinking of Secret Santa. Who could it be? Dan did not know it yet but he would get his answer later that night. The scenario was the same as it had been the previous two nights. Dan observed Santa quickly and silently entering the church building to place Christmas gifts underneath the tree for the children of the church. As Dan, for the third night in a row, spied on Santa from outside the sanctuary, he recalled with amusement receiving the first telephone call about the gifts underneath the tree from a curious parishioner late that morning. He told the caller that there was a Secret Santa Claus in the congregation but had no idea who he really was. Dan noticed that Santa reached into the sack of gifts with his left hand. Quickly and efficiently, as in the two nights previously, he was very graceful in his movements and wasted no time or effort. Dan thought to himself that this was no doubt how the real Santa Claus worked. How could it be otherwise if he wanted to visit all the homes of small children the world over in one night? Dan quietly trekked the few feet back to his office. Sitting silently as Santa quickly locked the front door and drove away, he thought seriously about the identity of his congregations’ Santa Claus. Very soon, more parishioners would be asking questions about Santa Claus and the presents underneath the tree. Pastor Dan thought of the five men who possessed keys to the main building. First on his mind was Al Busby. Al chaired the Church Council and was the oldest of the group at 77. He was a wonderful man but suffered from arthritic knees and walked with a cane. Next, he considered Chuck Daughtry. Chuck was the youngest of the men at age 33 and a member of the building committee. He was also a member of the church’s newly formed basketball team and the first to suffer injury in a game, badly breaking an arm a couple of weeks ago. Dan’s thoughts turned to Jim Dockery. Jim was 45 years old and a former professional baseball player. Jim was the Pastor-Parish Relations committee chair and, as such, Dan knew him well. He recalled fondly the last time they had dined together, discussing church business and swapping stories. He learned that Jim used to pitch for a Triple-A minor league team and was the first left-handed pitcher on that team to throw a no-hitter. He was very proud of that and Dan was a man who had much to be proud of, for Dan had grown wealthy with the computer company he had founded 15 years ago. Pastor Dan was deep in thought. But, he laughed out loud as he considered Bob Key as Santa Claus. Bobby, as he was called, was 65 years old and one of the most lovable men in the church. If anyone could be Santa Claus, it would be Bobby. However, Dan’s amusement turned to somberness as he recalled Bobby’s clumsiness. Last year, he broke a leg falling down stairs and, just recently, broke a lamp in Dan’s office during a meeting of the building committee. Finally, he thought of Jeff Reynolds. Jeff’s story was a sad one. Jeff was 41 years old but had suffered a minor stroke last year. He had lost his job stacking freight in a warehouse because he walked with a limp and had lost strength on his right side. But, his fate could have been far worse. He was the best committee worker of the five and had lost none of his organizational and administrative skills. Jeff and his family considered him very fortunate. Could a grateful Jeff Reynolds be “Secret Santa?” Sipping a cold diet cola, Dan sat in thoughtful silence until almost midnight. Then it came to him and he wondered why it took him so long to figure it out. Before locking up, a very relieved Pastor Dan called his wife to tell her he was coming home. Before hanging up, he said, “and I know who our Secret Santa is.”\nThe next day, Dan called the man who he suspected of being the congregation’s Santa Claus. After stating why he had called, the man admitted to being Secret Santa. Dan then asked him to come to his office for a visit. Santa complied and they met shortly after lunch.\nSanta wasted no time. Before even sitting down, he asked Dan, “How did you know it was me? I’m a little disturbed, for you know we are to do our good works in secret.”\nDan smiled and said, “Don’t worry. You’re secret is safe with me. Let me explain and then we’ll discuss how to proceed. I like what you are doing and the Santa suit is a nice touch.”\nJim said, “That’s just in case somebody like you happens to see me.”\nAfter a short pause, Dan continued, “You didn’t know it, but I watched you the last three nights. I know there are only five non-staff church members with keys to the building. My instincts told me it was not a staff member. So, it had to be one of five people – all men, as it turns out”\nSmiling, Santa said, “Your instincts did not lie to you.”\nSmiling back, Dan said, “I’m pleased you are feeling a bit better about being found out. So, how did I figure it out? Well, mainly by simple pastoral observation. I noticed early on that you walked quickly. Certainly Al Busby, 77 years old and crippled by arthritis, could not do that. I also saw that you carried the heavy sack with both hands. That counts Al Daughtry out. You know he has a badly broken arm.”\nDan paused a moment and both men chuckled. Santa asked, “That’s two down and good observations, Dan.”\nDan smiled and said. “Thanks. Now, I also noticed over the course of the last three evenings that you moved with a great deal of quickness and grace. You know how clumsy Bobby Key is. He would not be capable of doing what you did. So, that takes me next to Jeff Reynolds. As you know, his stroke last year has made him weak on his right side and walking with a limp.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the universe of people who could possibly get into the sanctuary after hours.  \n   • Only staff and five lay-members possess keys.  \n   • Pastor Dan’s intuition (and later observation) points away from staff, leaving exactly five candidates.\n\n2. Note what Pastor Dan actually sees.  \n   • “Santa” walks briskly, without cane or limp.  \n   • He carries a large, evidently heavy sack with both hands.  \n   • He works swiftly, silently and gracefully.  \n   • He repeatedly reaches into the sack with his LEFT hand.\n\n3. Compare those observations with the known physical conditions of the five key-holders.  \n   a) Al Busby – 77, arthritic knees, walks with a cane → cannot move briskly.  \n   b) Chuck Daughtry – has a badly broken arm (in a cast) → cannot lift/carry heavy sack with both hands.  \n   c) Bob (“Bobby”) Key – notoriously clumsy, recently broke a lamp and the year before a leg → unlikely to be silent, graceful, quick.  \n   d) Jeff Reynolds – post-stroke weakness on right side and a limp → brisk, balanced motion and two-handed lifting unlikely.  \n   e) Jim Dockery – former professional athlete, healthy, coordinated, and LEFT-HANDED.\n\n4. Motive analysis.  \n   • All five men are charitable church leaders, but Jim, financially comfortable from his computer company, has both means and a documented love of doing things “for the team” quietly.  \n   • His athletic background explains the choice of a playful disguise and the pleasure in stealthy performance.\n\n5. No alibis contradict his presence.  \n   • Late-night hours; none of the five was elsewhere by testimony.  \n   • Jim possesses a key and no physical impairment.\n\n6. Key forensic clue: left-handedness.  \n   • The only suspect explicitly identified as left-handed is Jim Dockery (“first left-handed pitcher on his team to throw a no-hitter”).  \n   • Pastor Dan repeatedly sees “Santa” scoop gifts with the left hand.\n\nConclusion: Only Jim fits every observed fact; the other four are ruled out either by physical incapacity or lack of the left-handed trait.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nAl Busby, Chuck Daughtry, Bob “Bobby” Key, Jeff Reynolds, Jim Dockery\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nJim Dockery\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter Thanksgiving, Jim Dockery decided to provide anonymous Christmas presents for children in the congregation. Owning one of the few keys to the new church, he chose late-night hours when the building appeared empty. Dressed in a Santa suit (to avoid recognition should anyone glimpse him), he entered through the front door, locked it behind him, and quickly, silently deposited gift-wrapped packages beneath the sanctuary tree. Being athletic and left-handed, he naturally carried and unloaded the heavy sack with both hands but reached in predominantly with his left. He repeated this operation on three consecutive nights, unaware that Pastor Dan, working late, observed him each time from the shadows. Dan compared what he saw with what he knew about the only five lay members who could have entered, eliminated four of them for physical reasons, recognized the tell-tale left-handedness, and correctly identified Jim as the Secret Santa. The next day Dan phoned Jim, who confirmed the deed and asked that his identity remain confidential so the focus would stay on Christian giving rather than on the giver.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Al Busby – His arthritis and reliance on a cane make brisk, silent movement impossible.  \n• Chuck Daughtry – A recently broken arm prevents him from lifting or carrying a large sack with both hands.  \n• Bob (“Bobby”) Key – His notorious clumsiness would make the silent, graceful operations Pastor Dan witnessed virtually impossible.  \n• Jeff Reynolds – Post-stroke weakness on the right side and a noticeable limp would not allow the smooth, balanced motion observed.  \nAll four also lack the distinctive left-handedness that Dan saw in “Santa.” Only Jim Dockery matches every single observed characteristic.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
