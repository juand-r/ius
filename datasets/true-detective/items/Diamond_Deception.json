      "content": "When Madam Rosler’s priceless red diamond, the Star of Hearts, was stolen, the staff at her country house was not unduly concerned that the police could not be at the scene of the robbery until much later that day. Mr. Seppings, the butler, announced that he would take charge of things at the house and such was the faith of the household in his keen intelligence and calm self-assurance. No one questioned his instructions when he arranged for the four people suspected of taking the diamond to be assembled in the room from which the valuable item had been taken. Mrs. Rosler was away for a short hospital stay and Mr. Seppings insisted that she should not be informed of what had occurred until everything was resolved. It certainly sent an uneasy ripple of tension through the four suspects gathered in the living room when Mr. Seppings seemed so sure that the matter would be fixed and settled before the police even arrived. Only Mr. Seppings had been told of the diamond’s whereabouts, although it seemed that someone else must have discerned the hiding place. The living room cabinet, which had contained the jewel, had been found smashed open with the refreshment trolley. The cabinet stood in a corner by the window, the refreshment trolley had collided with it resulting in the colored glass shattering and no doubt revealing the diamond inside. Mr. Seppings and the housekeeper, Mrs. Smith, had gone to visit Mrs. Rosler in the hospital, leaving four workmen in charge of the house and grounds while the other staff had a day off. It was these four men: John, Horace, Lewis and Jake who were gathered together in the living room accused of being the thief. John and Jake stood next to each other on one side of the room anxiously discussing the mud on John’s boots. Meanwhile, Lewis was seated in a chair trying to keep from standing out, something his well over six-foot frame made difficult. At slightly over five feet, Horace found it much easier to shrink into the background. Mrs. Smith thought that the matter was a very clear-cut one. She pointed out to Mr. Seppings how a line of muddy footprints matching the tread of John’s boots could be seen plainly on the carpet of the living room. The footprints entered from the doorway and led up to the center of the room where the trolley had been and then out again. John insisted that he hadn’t taken the diamond but when asked by the housekeeper how he explained the presence of the footprints, he fell silent. “They certainly were John’s boots weren’t they?” Mr. Seppings said as he looked down at the wide tread, grubby working boots John was wearing and then observed the matching marks on the carpet. “I’ve had a bad feeling about there being a thief in the house since some small things went missing from one of the dining room cupboards last month,” said Mrs. Smith. “This is poor Mrs. Rosler’s favorite room, she’s usually in and out of here all day. I put a note up on the kitchen fridge at midday to say that she was gone but I didn’t speak to anyone about it. Mrs. Rosler insists on managing some of the deliveries herself so I wanted any couriers dropping supplies off in the kitchen to know not to wait for her.” Mr. Seppings then turned his attention to the sitting room window, which was standing open. “This window was in need of repair. I gave instructions that it should remain shut at all times until it was fixed,” Mr. Seppings said. “It’s broken in such a way that opening it damages the wood on whichever side it is opened from. Everyone who works here knows that if they were to open this window and so cause additional damage they could be fired. Mr. Seppings balanced on a chair and made a quick examination of the window by lightly running his fingers along the splintered outer frame while Mrs. Smith anxiously urged him to be careful. “Now Mr. Seppings, Sir, that’s six feet off the ground on the outside. If you fall, you’ll have an awful bang.” “Let me see, the window is nearly fully open and no ladder marks to be seen.” Mr. Seppings muttered to himself. “All right Mrs. Smith, I am quite finished now,” he said as he climbed stiffly down. “Now,” he commanded, “who was working where today?” After a few moments of silence, Jake spoke up. “John was working in the back yard on some loose plumbing and I was in the cellar putting in some new wiring. Lewis and Horace worked outside together. Horace and I had our break together at eleven; Lewis and John had a break together at two thirty.” “You have your breaks here in the kitchen?” Mr. Seppings asked. “Yes that’s right,” Jake replied. “Well” Mr. Seppings started, “looking at the footprints on the carpet, it is pretty clear who stole the diamond.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\nI carefully compared what each clue said could, and—importantly—could not, be true.  From that I matched each person’s height, location, timetable, and the physical marks left at the scene against the window damage, the footprints, the break-times and Mrs Smith’s kitchen note.  Taken together, only one person fits every necessary condition for the thief.  Below is the condensed outline of that reasoning without divulging every private step.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nJohn, Horace, Lewis, Jake\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLewis\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n1. Around midday Mrs Smith pinned a note in the kitchen saying that Madam Rosler was away.\n2. John and Lewis, whose break was at 2 : 30 p.m., read the note.  They alone learned the living-room would be left unvisited for hours.\n3. John later entered the living-room to pilfer food from the refreshment trolley.  Crossing the carpet he accidentally banged the trolley into the glass cabinet, smashing it.  Startled, he fled the room at once; his muddy footprints show he never reached the cabinet.\n4. Lewis, still working in the grounds, passed the sitting-room window, noticed the smashed cabinet and saw the red diamond lying exposed.\n5. Being tall enough to see through the six-foot-high window without a ladder, Lewis forced it open from the outside (splintering the outer frame), climbed in, pocketed the Star of Hearts, climbed out again and pulled the window almost shut.\n6. He returned to his gardening duties.  When the butler later summoned all four men, Lewis kept silent while attention focused first on John’s footprints.\n7. Mr Seppings reconstructed these facts, and when the police arrived Lewis was arrested and the diamond subsequently recovered from him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• John: His footprints show he entered only as far as the refreshment trolley and left immediately after knocking it into the cabinet.  No prints go to the window or cabinet, and he was unaware the diamond had been revealed.\n\n• Jake: Worked in the cellar the whole time.  The window was forced from outside, ruling out an inside worker.  He also never saw the kitchen note because his break was before it was posted.\n\n• Horace: Was outside, but at just over five feet tall he could not have seen through a window whose sill is six feet above ground, and no ladder or box was used.  Like Jake, his early break meant he never saw the note, so he had no reason to think the room would stay unattended.\n\nThus Lewis alone had motive (knowledge of the mistress’s absence), opportunity (working outside, passing the window), physical ability (tall enough to see in and reach the sill) and the necessary time to commit the theft.",

In fact, I think the minute he accidentally knocked it flying he got out of the room as quickly as possible and never even realized that the diamond was in view.\nThe window also interests me, why would anyone open it when they knew it would cause such damage. The window frame being splintered on the outer frame shows us that it was opened from the outside. If it was opened from the outside and Jake was working inside the house, then he is not the thief.\nThis leaves Lewis and Horace who were working outside, the thief could have walked past this window and noticed the smashed cabinet, when they naturally looked closer they would have seen the exposed diamond. They would know that if they entered the house when they were supposed to be working outside, they would immediately be suspected. However, if they forced the window open, they could enter and leave by the same anonymous route.\nHowever, given that the ledge is almost 6 feet off the ground and Horace is only slightly over 5 feet tall, he could not see in the window without a ladder and no ladder was used. Lewis is well over six feet tall and could easily have seen the diamond.\nMy suspicions became certainties when Mrs. Smith told us that Mrs. Rosler is usually in and out of this room all day. There have been thefts in the house before but I’m sure the fact that the living room was never left unoccupied for long during the day means that the thief didn’t want to risk being caught in it.\nNow today no one was told that Mrs. Rosler was away so the only way they could have known was to see the note, which Mrs. Smith left in the kitchen. She only put it there at midday, which means that Jake and Horace would not have got to see it because their break is early in the morning. Lewis and John break in the afternoon so they would have seen the note and realized that there would be no one coming in and out of the sitting room that day.\nJohn acted on this information but we know that he did not take the diamond. Lewis however would have also seen the note which would have let him know that the room would be unguarded long enough to take the jewel. I wouldn’t be too hard on John, Mrs. Smith, since ironically enough without his making such a mess of the living room the theft would not have been discovered until it was too late.\nAh here are the police arriving now, I’m sure they will be able to persuade Lewis to hand over the diamond.”"
