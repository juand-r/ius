      "content": "Rubbernecking is a dangerous sport. I should know, because I just about hit a cop on my drive to the racket club. There was a traffic accident on the corner of Main and King, blocking the entrance to the Java Hut. The ornate “Open” sign inside the Java Hut window taunted me -- if I could just get past the yellow barricades, I thought. As I surveyed the wreckage, mourning the loss of my morning coffee, I almost missed the fact that the streetlight had changed from green to red. As I slammed on the breaks, with my car stopping inches from a police officer crossing the road, I knew that I was in big trouble. Fortunately, I got off with just a warning. The police officer came to my window and glared at me. “You should keep your eyes on the road,” he said. “Sorry, officer,” I said. “I’ll be more careful in the future. But if you don’t mind my asking, what happened here?” “Yes, I do mind,” he said, and strode off just before the light turned green. I resisted the urge to sneak another glance at the accident scene, but my curiosity was fulfilled later. Anyway ... when I arrived at the racket club, I felt like calling that police officer to help me out because the club’s patrons had to pay for parking, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s just criminal (especially considering that I know how much my cousin Dave Perkins paid in membership dues). And it wasn’t even a flat fee for parking, they gave you a time-stamped ticket and you had to pay for every quarter hour segment of your stay on your way out. It didn’t seem to bother my cousin, though. When I entered the club’s lobby, Dave was waiting for me on a leather couch drinking a cup of Java Hut coffee. He looked relaxed. “Don’t get too comfortable,” I said. I pointed at the clock -- it was 9:50 a.m. “Our court time is in ten minutes. And that means you’ll be losing in exactly eleven minutes ...” “Are you sure you’re up for this?” Dave asked. “You haven’t played squash in years.” “I beat you when we were teenagers, and I’ll beat you now,” I said. “Loser buys lunch,” he said. Good thing I brought my credit card. I lost -- badly -- and I had a sinking suspicion that Dave would order the club’s most expensive bottle of wine. But first we decided to hit the steam room. My aching muscles needed it. Dave’s co-workers from the Water Works plumbing company, Larry Douglas and Chris Henderson, were already in the steam room when we arrived after our half-hour session on the squash court. “I squashed Larry,” Chris gloated after Dave introduced me. “Did you take care of Dave?” “Well,” I said, embarrassed. “I, uh--” “He was off his game because he didn’t have his morning coffee,” Dave said, coming to my rescue. “Java Hut was—“ “Big deal,” Chris said, “Java Hut was closed when I drove by, too. I beat Larry with un-caffeinated skill.” “That’s because I was half asleep from waiting for you so long on that comfy couch out front,” Larry said. “I wondered why you were still in here,” Dave said. “I thought you had a 9:30 court time.” “We did, but we didn’t end up starting until 9:45. Good thing you guys booked a different court number. There was nobody on ours after us, so we played until nearly 10:30. Besides, he only beat me by--” “Never mind your scores,” said Nathan Elliot as he entered the steam room. “We’ve got more important things to talk about.” Water Works’ owner stood at the door with his arms crossed. Unlike the rest of us, he wasn’t dressed in just a large towel; he wore a three-piece suit. He looked very uncomfortable as the steam caused him to sweat instantly. But it was my turn to feel uncomfortable when he turned his focus on me. His eyes narrowed. “Who are you?” he demanded. “I’m Dave’s cousin, Rick,” I said, trying my best to sound friendly in deference to not causing Dave any problems. “I believe I took your place on the squash court today.” “That’s right,” Nathan said. “I wasn’t supposed to be here” He looked down at his suit, “Obviously. I left my niece’s wedding to fire one of you!” All three of his employees sat bolt upright, suddenly on edge. I, too, felt the stress of the situation, despite not being at any personal risk. Then again, I was at risk of passing out from too much steam. Nathan, who for all intents and purposes was blocking the exit, said, “I’m not moving until I find out who caused that accident at Main and King.” “What makes you think it was one of us?” Chris asked. “Witnesses all described our Water Works vans. No one caught the license plate, but it had to be one of you three.” “Or you,” I said. I was no longer worried about being friendly. If he was the culprit and he was trying to frame my cousin, then Dave would have a lot more to worry about than losing his job. And I have to admit, that if Dave was guilty, the thought of providing an alibi for him did cross my mind. But only momentarily. Do the crime, do the time, I always say. “I didn’t drive my van to the wedding -- while I normally love getting the company logo in front of as many eyeballs as possible, my wife would never step foot in that van in an expensive gown,” Nathan said. “What time did the accident happen?” Larry asked. “Around 9:35.” “I got here at 8:30,” Larry said, “I have a ticket on my dash.” “Did anyone see you?” Nathan asked. “Well, no, but ... why don’t you just go look at our vans,” Larry said. “Mine’s in the parking lot and it’ll be obvious from looking at it that it hasn’t been in any accidents.” “I didn’t say any of you idiots were in an accident,” Nathan said, losing his temper as his suit clung tighter to his sweat-soaked body. “One of you ran a red light. A car that had the right of way swerved to avoid you and smashed into another car. Nobody died, thank God, but I’m sure the police are going to want to talk to whichever one of you walks out of here unemployed ...” “Go ahead and call the police, I said. “I know who caused the accident.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish the moment of the accident  \n   • Nathan says the accident occurred “around 9:35.”  \n   • Rick reaches that same corner a few minutes later (light already green-to-red) and cannot get into the Java Hut because the wreckage blocks the entrance, yet he can still see the “OPEN” sign and the staff inside.\n\n2. List who could possibly have been driving a Water Works van at 9:35  \n   • Nathan Elliot – owner, claims to have been at his niece’s wedding in a private car.  \n   • Dave Perkins – Water Works employee, already at the club drinking Java Hut coffee when Rick walks in at 9:50.  \n   • Larry Douglas – Water Works employee, says he arrived at the club at 8:30 and bought a pay-and-display parking-ticket (proof on his dashboard).  \n   • Chris Henderson – Water Works employee, scheduled to meet Larry at 9:30 but turns up late; they do not start their game until 9:45.  \n\n3. Check everyone’s alibi/opportunity\n\n   Nathan: plenty of wedding witnesses; not in a company van at all. He therefore lacks both opportunity and the matching vehicle.\n\n   Larry: dashboard ticket stamped 8:30 proves his van was already parked before the 9:35 crash. From 9:30 on he is either waiting for Chris or on court (9:45-10:30) where Dave and the club staff can place him.\n\n   Dave: could only have bought his Java Hut coffee before 9:35 because the entrance was blocked afterward. To be waiting, relaxed, on the club sofa at 9:50 he must have left Main & King well before the crash. In short, he was clear of the intersection before the red-light incident.\n\n   Chris: no documented arrival time before 9:35, in fact the opposite—he is conspicuously late, turning up at 9:45. That gives him exactly the right travel window to be at Main & King at 9:35.\n\n4. Look for contradictions or lies\n\n   • Chris says “Java Hut was closed when I drove by.”  \n   – Rick saw the “OPEN” sign illuminated and staff inside immediately after the accident; it was access that was blocked, not the shop itself.  \n   – Therefore Chris is lying about what he saw, indicating he was on the scene after the accident he himself caused and is now inventing a cover story.\n\n5. Motive\n\n   Not a strong motive is needed: Chris was running late for his 9:30 squash court, saw a yellow light “turning orange,” decided to beat it, and blasted through the red to avoid paying for a lost booking or being chewed out by his boss. That haste explains both the infraction and his lateness.\n\n6. Logical deduction\n\n   • Only one Water Works van was reported.  \n   • Only Chris had the necessary time window and no corroborated alibi.  \n   • He is also caught in a factual lie about the Java Hut’s status.  \n   → Chris Henderson must be the driver who ran the red light and triggered the pile-up.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nChris Henderson, Larry Douglas, Dave Perkins, Nathan Elliot\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nChris Henderson\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n09:20 a.m. (approx.) – Dave Perkins stops at Java Hut, buys his coffee, and drives on to the racket club.\n\n08:30 a.m. – Larry Douglas parks his Water Works van at the club, purchases a dashboard parking ticket, and waits in the lobby.\n\n~09:30 a.m. – Chris Henderson is running late, speeding his Water Works van toward the club. Seeing the light at Main & King turn yellow, he decides to “beat it,” enters the intersection on red, and keeps going.\n\n09:35 a.m. – A car with the legal green swerves to avoid Chris’s van and collides with another vehicle. Chris, rattled and already late, continues on without stopping. The wreckage blocks the Java Hut driveway but the shop remains open.\n\n09:38-09:40 a.m. – Rick reaches the intersection, is diverted around the crash scene, and cannot access the coffee shop.\n\n09:45 a.m. – Chris finally reaches the club; he and Larry start their squash match late.\n\n09:50 a.m. – Rick arrives; Dave is already seated with his earlier-purchased Java Hut coffee.\n\n10:15-10:30 a.m. – While Chris and Larry are still on court, Nathan leaves the wedding, learns from police that a Water Works van caused the crash, and drives to the club.\n\nShortly thereafter, in the steam room confrontation, Chris’s false statement about the Java Hut being “closed” exposes him. With no alibi and caught in a lie, he is identified as the red-light runner and promptly fired.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Nathan Elliot – Multiple wedding guests can testify he was at the ceremony, and he was not driving a company van.\n\n• Larry Douglas – The 8:30 parking-meter ticket proves his van had been stationary at the club long before the 9:35 accident. Dave, Chris, and club staff saw him waiting or playing during the critical time.\n\n• Dave Perkins – His cup of fresh Java Hut coffee shows he reached Main & King before the crash; once the wreck occurred the driveway was impassable. He was already at the club by 9:50, comfortably ahead of the incident.\n\nOnly Chris lacks an alibi, fits the time window, was driving a Water Works van, and lied about the Java Hut’s status, making him the sole viable culprit.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

When I got here, Dave was drinking a fresh Java Hut coffee, so obviously he was at Main and King before the accident happened.”\nChris jumped up. Being the only suspect unaccounted for, he looked ready to attack me. “This is crazy. You have no proof. I told you the Java Hut was closed when I went by, so obviously the accident had already happened.”\n“But the Java Hut wasn’t closed,” I said. “That’s how I knew you were lying. The sign still said, ‘open’, and the employees were still visible watching from inside the shop, I just couldn’t get to them.”\n“We play squash every weekend, Chris,” Larry said reproachfully. “It wouldn’t have been a big deal if we lost our court time today.
