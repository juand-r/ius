      "content": "The last performance of “Murder by Design,” a classic 1930's Broadway thriller that had once been a vehicle for Tallulah Bankhead, was going smoothly. In the last act, the Detective, played with sinister smoothness by Straw Hat Theater leading man Sam Watson, was slowly revealing that he was the actual murderer of two victims. Now to the gradual realization and horror of leading lady Stella Marlowe, it looked like she would soon be added to the list. Just in time, police officers, bothered by inconsistencies in the Detective’s story, had arrived to check things out and confronted him. At this point, stage directions called for Watson to take a dive through the window at rear stage right, a suicidal move for the character, for the setting, a shorefront mansion, backed onto a cliff with grand, sweeping views of the ocean far below. Then would come the final curtain. Watson fired the gun wildly as he backed towards the window. In every other production, the Detective’s dive through the window ended the play. Then, disbelief would be suspended a few moments later, when the curtain rose with all of the actors gradually coming onstage for their bows, to the tumultuous applause of the appreciative audience. Except this time, the actors looked stricken. And Stella Marlowe was still on the sofa where she had been when the play ended. Not in the script was the neat bullet hole on her left side with its ever- widening circle of dark blood staining her dress, as it emerged from what had been her heart. Pandemonium struck the audience. Even though I am Police Chief of this Vermont town, I had never before seen an actual murder. Whoops, I mean killing. I shouldn't use the M word until that was proved, you see. Anyway, I took charge, let the audience go, and after a call to my two deputies, started to take statements from anyone who might possibly have had anything to do with that gun. For it wasn't the usual prop gun, you see. It was a real gun, roughly the same size and weight, which had been placed on the props table by Linda Eberlie, the Straw Hat Theater’s prop master. And it had been loaded. A six- shooter, it had contained just the one bullet that had done the job when Sam Watson pulled the trigger. I suppose that meant that whoever had made the gun switch hadn't wanted to leave many clues behind and extra bullets might have been evidence of some sort. All the time that I've been Police Chief here and I still don't understand the way that a criminal’s mind works. There was a back- story, of course. There always is, behind what people tell you at first. For what you hear then is what they have carefully constructed, to make themselves look good, or to deflect suspicion, or perhaps, if they are really nasty, to put suspicion onto someone else. The people I tend to believe are those who do not do that, I mean, the witnesses who tell you just what they saw and don't embroider. There aren't too many of them, believe me. Anyway, what I heard was about the victim. It turns out that Stella Marlowe was very difficult to work with, given to perfectionism and temper tantrums. She had often engaged in shouting matches with Director Arthur Glendon, who was even heard to say during one tiff, “I'd like to wring your neck!” He wished now that he could have retracted those words. In fact, he was soon at work writing a memorial talk on what a fine actress she had been, which he intended to give at her funeral service. It also turned out that she had another enemy, a former boyfriend, none other than leading man Sam Watson. She had just broken up with him, impulsive as usual, when her previous (and very rich) boyfriend, Josh Whitehead, had driven up from New York to see the play. Of course, it was pretty clear from my talk with Whitehead that he had had no idea whatsoever that until he showed up, he was considered history! And when he was readmitted to grace and favor from Ms. Marlowe, his mood wasn't improved when he caught her and Sam Watson an hour later in a torrid embrace. “It was her way of saying goodbye,” Watson sort of explained. One surely needed an emotional traffic cop to sort out when her goodbye meant that and not “Hello!” Later on, I saw the dressing rooms, which were cordoned off by one of my deputies. In Sam Watson’s dressing room, there was the usual setup of makeup and mirror, plus lots of reading material. He wasn't a very sociable guy, it seemed. When he wasn't on stage acting or rehearsing, he'd rather just stay in his dressing room with a good book or a magazine. He seemed to favor thriller novels and for magazines, the latest from Hollywood and those catering to hunters or fishermen. Therefore, Watson was probably a gun enthusiast. Stella Marlowe’s dressing room was a shrine to herself. It was probably endearing in its way, with all of those pictures of her in her various stage roles, but now, it just gave me a feeling of sadness and loss. I'd never seen her act before, but I've got to admit, her performance in the first two acts of tonight’s play had been excellent. And I guess she was religious after her fashion. There was a photograph of her, wearing a shawl, at Lourdes in France, and a rosary was on the side table, within easy reach of her dressing table chair. The next day, ballistics and police reports were in. The gun that was used to kill Stella Marlowe was registered to Arthur Glendon. ***** “All right, Glendon, what was going on between you and Stella Marlowe?” “Nothing whatsoever, Chief.” I persisted. “Do you own a gun?” “Sure: I own a revolver - want to see it?” Glendon opened the lower left-hand drawer of his desk and looked for a moment, puzzled and then worried. “It’s not here!” “When is the last time you saw it, Glendon?” “I don't know, Chief\" he replied. \"Maybe a few weeks.” I went on, although I knew he wouldn't like the question. “Did you keep it loaded?” “Of course not!” Glendon was indignant. “Did anybody else know you had a gun?” “I didn't make a secret of it,\" Glendon replied. “Come to think of it, in a show earlier this season, Linda Eberlie was in a crunch for props, and she made a general announcement asking for a gun. She needed it for a show, and her props were late arriving from Philadelphia. So I lent her this gun - unloaded of course!” “And she returned it?” “Yes,\" said Glendon. \"She returned it to me, in this very room, after the set was struck following the last performance of that show.” ***** Sam Watson was in a state of shock. I offered him a drink of his own Scotch, and he turned it down. “You don't understand, Chief. Regardless of whose idea this was, I was used to kill Stella Marlowe. It’s horrible.” “Just a few questions, Watson. You're a hunter, I suppose?” “No, Chief. Fly-fishing is more my style. Breathing the fresh air while fishing is my idea of heaven. Rainbow trout, now that’s my sport. Excellent eating, too, and its easy to make. Even I couldn't mess up frying trout, and I'm no gourmet chef, believe me!” He seemed to be feeling a little better. “Tell me, Watson, I gather it was all over between you and Stella Marlowe?” “So you found out about that, Chief? Well, I suppose I'm too old for a summer fling, but between you and me, I was just as glad when it ended. Seems her old boyfriend had staked a prior claim, and he had the financial resources to offer her a lifestyle that I never could. So it’s back to Linda, if she'll have me!” “So you had been dating Linda Eberlie?” “Sure, Chief. We tried to keep it to ourselves, but that’s not possible in a small theater group.” “What can you tell me about that last scene?”\n \n“Chief, I've been kicking myself ever since, for not making anything of the fact that the gun on the props table was just a bit heavier than the gun I had used at previous performances. I noticed it, but I didn't make anything of it. And then, the firing. Usually I just aim in the air. But this time, the cop running onstage just jostled me enough so that the shot went straight at Stella. It was horrible!” ***** I interviewed Josh Whitehead at his motel. “What a terrible loss, Inspector, or Chief, whatever you're called. She was a good actress and potentially more than that.” “Were you jealous of Sam Watson?” “You bet I was, Chief. And let me tell you this. He is the one I wanted to take out - never Stella. But even if I'd wanted to, this is the first time I've been to Vermont. I wouldn't know where to buy a drink, let alone a gun!” ***** Linda Eberlie was in a state of near shock herself, so I began in low key fashion. “I hear that you and Sam Watson will be getting together, Ms. Eberlie.” She smiled. “Yes. That’s the good news. I don't deny that I was upset with Stella Marlowe for stealing my boyfriend. Maybe she felt a sense of remorse after all. I've been wondering if she hadn't switched the real gun with my prop gun. I suppose you've talked with Arthur Glendon, and know that the gun used was his - everyone knew that he had one and where he kept it. “My guess, Chief, is that she couldn't stand losing Sam. Having him fire that shot was her way out - and her way of making sure that Sam and I never got together after all. So I'll be skipping that memorial ceremony that Arthur is planning. It just wouldn't seem right.” ***** I called the cast together and made sure that Josh Whitehead was there too. “I've never seen a case quite like this before,\" I said, \"and I hope I never do again. But I'm ready to make the arrest right now - we'll call this one, the Final Curtain.”",

Sam Watson, a fisherman and not a hunter, was tired of Stella, and glad to get back to reliable Linda Eberlie, or so he thought.\nIn arranging for the real, loaded gun to be used, Linda wanted Stella Marlowe to be scared out of her wits, and never return to the Straw Hat Theater Company.

          "prompt": "System: You are an ingenious and clever detective who will examine all the clues and reason through all the evidence to solve the crime.\n\nUser: Here is a detective puzzle. Please read the story carefully before you decide who the culprit is.\n\n\nThe last performance of “Murder by Design,” a classic 1930's Broadway thriller that had once been a vehicle for Tallulah Bankhead, was going smoothly. In the last act, the Detective, played with sinister smoothness by Straw Hat Theater leading man Sam Watson, was slowly revealing that he was the actual murderer of two victims. Now to the gradual realization and horror of leading lady Stella Marlowe, it looked like she would soon be added to the list. Just in time, police officers, bothered by inconsistencies in the Detective’s story, had arrived to check things out and confronted him. At this point, stage directions called for Watson to take a dive through the window at rear stage right, a suicidal move for the character, for the setting, a shorefront mansion, backed onto a cliff with grand, sweeping views of the ocean far below. Then would come the final curtain. Watson fired the gun wildly as he backed towards the window. In every other production, the Detective’s dive through the window ended the play. Then, disbelief would be suspended a few moments later, when the curtain rose with all of the actors gradually coming onstage for their bows, to the tumultuous applause of the appreciative audience. Except this time, the actors looked stricken. And Stella Marlowe was still on the sofa where she had been when the play ended. Not in the script was the neat bullet hole on her left side with its ever- widening circle of dark blood staining her dress, as it emerged from what had been her heart. Pandemonium struck the audience. Even though I am Police Chief of this Vermont town, I had never before seen an actual murder. Whoops, I mean killing. I shouldn't use the M word until that was proved, you see. Anyway, I took charge, let the audience go, and after a call to my two deputies, started to take statements from anyone who might possibly have had anything to do with that gun. For it wasn't the usual prop gun, you see. It was a real gun, roughly the same size and weight, which had been placed on the props table by Linda Eberlie, the Straw Hat Theater’s prop master. And it had been loaded. A six- shooter, it had contained just the one bullet that had done the job when Sam Watson pulled the trigger. I suppose that meant that whoever had made the gun switch hadn't wanted to leave many clues behind and extra bullets might have been evidence of some sort. All the time that I've been Police Chief here and I still don't understand the way that a criminal’s mind works. There was a back- story, of course. There always is, behind what people tell you at first. For what you hear then is what they have carefully constructed, to make themselves look good, or to deflect suspicion, or perhaps, if they are really nasty, to put suspicion onto someone else. The people I tend to believe are those who do not do that, I mean, the witnesses who tell you just what they saw and don't embroider. There aren't too many of them, believe me. Anyway, what I heard was about the victim. It turns out that Stella Marlowe was very difficult to work with, given to perfectionism and temper tantrums. She had often engaged in shouting matches with Director Arthur Glendon, who was even heard to say during one tiff, “I'd like to wring your neck!” He wished now that he could have retracted those words. In fact, he was soon at work writing a memorial talk on what a fine actress she had been, which he intended to give at her funeral service. It also turned out that she had another enemy, a former boyfriend, none other than leading man Sam Watson. She had just broken up with him, impulsive as usual, when her previous (and very rich) boyfriend, Josh Whitehead, had driven up from New York to see the play. Of course, it was pretty clear from my talk with Whitehead that he had had no idea whatsoever that until he showed up, he was considered history! And when he was readmitted to grace and favor from Ms. Marlowe, his mood wasn't improved when he caught her and Sam Watson an hour later in a torrid embrace. “It was her way of saying goodbye,” Watson sort of explained. One surely needed an emotional traffic cop to sort out when her goodbye meant that and not “Hello!” Later on, I saw the dressing rooms, which were cordoned off by one of my deputies. In Sam Watson’s dressing room, there was the usual setup of makeup and mirror, plus lots of reading material. He wasn't a very sociable guy, it seemed. When he wasn't on stage acting or rehearsing, he'd rather just stay in his dressing room with a good book or a magazine. He seemed to favor thriller novels and for magazines, the latest from Hollywood and those catering to hunters or fishermen. Therefore, Watson was probably a gun enthusiast. Stella Marlowe’s dressing room was a shrine to herself. It was probably endearing in its way, with all of those pictures of her in her various stage roles, but now, it just gave me a feeling of sadness and loss. I'd never seen her act before, but I've got to admit, her performance in the first two acts of tonight’s play had been excellent. And I guess she was religious after her fashion. There was a photograph of her, wearing a shawl, at Lourdes in France, and a rosary was on the side table, within easy reach of her dressing table chair. The next day, ballistics and police reports were in. The gun that was used to kill Stella Marlowe was registered to Arthur Glendon. ***** “All right, Glendon, what was going on between you and Stella Marlowe?” “Nothing whatsoever, Chief.” I persisted. “Do you own a gun?” “Sure: I own a revolver - want to see it?” Glendon opened the lower left-hand drawer of his desk and looked for a moment, puzzled and then worried. “It’s not here!” “When is the last time you saw it, Glendon?” “I don't know, Chief\" he replied. \"Maybe a few weeks.” I went on, although I knew he wouldn't like the question. “Did you keep it loaded?” “Of course not!” Glendon was indignant. “Did anybody else know you had a gun?” “I didn't make a secret of it,\" Glendon replied. “Come to think of it, in a show earlier this season, Linda Eberlie was in a crunch for props, and she made a general announcement asking for a gun. She needed it for a show, and her props were late arriving from Philadelphia. So I lent her this gun - unloaded of course!” “And she returned it?” “Yes,\" said Glendon. \"She returned it to me, in this very room, after the set was struck following the last performance of that show.” ***** Sam Watson was in a state of shock. I offered him a drink of his own Scotch, and he turned it down. “You don't understand, Chief. Regardless of whose idea this was, I was used to kill Stella Marlowe. It’s horrible.” “Just a few questions, Watson. You're a hunter, I suppose?” “No, Chief. Fly-fishing is more my style. Breathing the fresh air while fishing is my idea of heaven. Rainbow trout, now that’s my sport. Excellent eating, too, and its easy to make. Even I couldn't mess up frying trout, and I'm no gourmet chef, believe me!” He seemed to be feeling a little better. “Tell me, Watson, I gather it was all over between you and Stella Marlowe?” “So you found out about that, Chief? Well, I suppose I'm too old for a summer fling, but between you and me, I was just as glad when it ended. Seems her old boyfriend had staked a prior claim, and he had the financial resources to offer her a lifestyle that I never could. So it’s back to Linda, if she'll have me!” “So you had been dating Linda Eberlie?” “Sure, Chief. We tried to keep it to ourselves, but that’s not possible in a small theater group.” “What can you tell me about that last scene?”\n \n“Chief, I've been kicking myself ever since, for not making anything of the fact that the gun on the props table was just a bit heavier than the gun I had used at previous performances. I noticed it, but I didn't make anything of it. And then, the firing. Usually I just aim in the air. But this time, the cop running onstage just jostled me enough so that the shot went straight at Stella. It was horrible!” ***** I interviewed Josh Whitehead at his motel. “What a terrible loss, Inspector, or Chief, whatever you're called. She was a good actress and potentially more than that.” “Were you jealous of Sam Watson?” “You bet I was, Chief. And let me tell you this. He is the one I wanted to take out - never Stella. But even if I'd wanted to, this is the first time I've been to Vermont. I wouldn't know where to buy a drink, let alone a gun!” ***** Linda Eberlie was in a state of near shock herself, so I began in low key fashion. “I hear that you and Sam Watson will be getting together, Ms. Eberlie.” She smiled. “Yes. That’s the good news. I don't deny that I was upset with Stella Marlowe for stealing my boyfriend. Maybe she felt a sense of remorse after all. I've been wondering if she hadn't switched the real gun with my prop gun. I suppose you've talked with Arthur Glendon, and know that the gun used was his - everyone knew that he had one and where he kept it. “My guess, Chief, is that she couldn't stand losing Sam. Having him fire that shot was her way out - and her way of making sure that Sam and I never got together after all. So I'll be skipping that memorial ceremony that Arthur is planning. It just wouldn't seem right.” ***** I called the cast together and made sure that Josh Whitehead was there too. “I've never seen a case quite like this before,\" I said, \"and I hope I never do again. But I'm ready to make the arrest right now - we'll call this one, the Final Curtain.”\nStella Marlowe, a practicing Catholic, would regard suicide as sinful. It is therefore highly unlikely that she would kill herself, much less arrange a plot whereby somebody else would pull the trigger to kill her. Josh Whitehead was furious, but with Sam Watson, not with Stella Marlowe. And as he points out, this was his first trip to Vermont. He is the only suspect who would not have known about Arthur Glendon’s gun.\nArthur Glendon freely admitted his gun ownership to the Chief of Police, before he knew that it was the gun used to shoot Stella Marlowe. Sam Watson, a fisherman and not a hunter, was tired of Stella, and glad to get back to reliable Linda Eberlie, or so he thought.\nIn arranging for the real, loaded gun to be used, Linda wanted Stella Marlowe to be scared out of her wits, and never return to the Straw Hat Theater Company. The cast knew about Arthur’s pistol, but Linda was the one who arranged the props table. It was sheer bad luck that an actor policeman jostled Sam Watson’s arm onstage, so that the shot rang true and killed Stella Marlowe.

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.\tWHO HAD A REASON TO CHANGE THE GUN?\n    •  Arthur Glendon – had quarrelled with Stella, but he was counting on her to finish the play and was busy directing it.  \n    •  Sam Watson – had just extricated himself from a turbulent affair with Stella and was relieved; killing her would only ruin his career and his renewed romance with Linda.  \n    •  Josh Whitehead – was angry with Sam, not with Stella, and had no knowledge of the theatre’s backstage routine or of Glendon’s revolver.  \n    •  Linda Eberlie – had the strongest grievance (Stella had stolen her boyfriend), handled all hand props every performance, and had previously borrowed Glendon’s revolver, so she knew exactly where it was kept.\n\n2.\tWHO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY?\n    •  Only the property-master normally touches the stage weapons.  Linda alone could place the gun on the prop table without attracting attention.  \n    •  To steal the gun she needed either a key to Glendon’s drawer or to have kept it when she “returned” it after the earlier show.  Either way, her access was unhindered.  \n    •  The others would have had to sneak into the locked prop room, choose the right revolver, load it and set it out – all without Linda noticing.  That is implausible.\n\n3.\tPHYSICAL FACTS\n    •  The weapon is Glendon’s; it left his office.  The prop revolver (a blank-firing replica) has vanished.  \n    •  The live weapon contained only one round – someone who merely wanted a loud report (to frighten, not necessarily to kill) would load as little evidence as possible: exactly one cartridge.  \n    •  Sam noticed the slight extra weight – proof the exchange was very recent; if he had made the switch himself he would already know it was heavier.\n\n4.\tLOGIC\n    •  Suicide is ruled out: Stella was a practising Catholic; the plot would require her to steal a gun she did not know existed and to rely on Sam’s marksmanship – impossible.  \n    •  Josh cannot have done it: first visit to Vermont; no knowledge of backstage routine or of Glendon’s gun.  \n    •  Glendon unintentionally supplied the weapon but clearly thought it was still in his drawer and admitted owning it before the police told him it had been used.  Keeping a gun loaded “with just one bullet” makes no sense for him, but it makes perfect sense for the person who loaded it that afternoon.  \n    •  Sam physically fired the weapon, but only because the script required him to.  His description of being bumped by the stage policeman is consistent with an accidental hit, and no one has shown any reason he would want Stella dead during a live performance in front of 300 witnesses.\n\n5.\tTherefore the person who both had the MOTIVE (jealousy), the MEANS (prior possession of the revolver and the know-how to load it) and the OPPORTUNITY (sole control of the prop table) is Linda Eberlie.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nArthur Glendon, Sam Watson, Josh Whitehead, Linda Eberlie, Stella Marlowe\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nLinda Eberlie\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nThree weeks earlier, when Linda Eberlie borrowed Arthur Glendon’s revolver for another show, she never returned it; she put the (empty) replica back in Glendon’s desk and quietly kept the real weapon.  \nDuring the last-night tensions she realised Stella had once again come between her and Sam.  Furious, she decided to frighten the actress enough to make her quit the company for good.  On the afternoon of the final performance she slipped a single live round into Glendon’s revolver and placed that gun on the props table where Sam would pick it up for the final scene.  The blank-firing prop was hidden or discarded.  \nOn stage Sam followed the usual blocking, firing high.  An actor playing a policeman rushed in and accidentally collided with him; the muzzle swung down and the single live bullet struck Stella Marlowe in the heart.  \nWhen Linda heard the shot she realised the prank had turned to tragedy.  Because only one cartridge had been loaded, there were no extra shells to identify her.  She said nothing, hoping everyone would think it an inexplicable accident – but the chain of access and her unique opportunity point straight to her.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n•  Arthur Glendon – admitted the revolver was his before he knew it had been used and believed it was still in his drawer; directing the performance, he had no chance to tamper with the prop table.  \n•  Sam Watson – the gun was handed to him immediately before the scene; he had no reason to jeopardise his career and new relationship and showed genuine shock.  \n•  Josh Whitehead – first time in town, no backstage access, angry at Sam not Stella, and unaware of Glendon’s weapon.  \n•  Stella Marlowe – as a devout Catholic she would not plan her own death; she also did not control the props.  \nOnly Linda Eberlie possessed motive, means, and opportunity.  She alone is guilty. \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",
