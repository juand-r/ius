      "content": "Corporal James Prescott of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police leaned back in his chair and looked out the window of his tiny office, located in the rear of the small station house. He almost went snow-blind just glancing at the brilliant white scenery outside. A weekend snowstorm had blanketed the surrounding countryside in another twenty inches of the white stuff, and the bright sun in the cold, clear sky reflecting off the crisp snow dazzled the eyes. Corporal Prescott blinked and turned away, took another sip of coffee from the steaming mug on his desk. He jumped when Constable Marchildon suddenly stuck her head in the door and said, “All four of them are here now, Jim.” “Right,” Prescott snapped, his break now over. The door closed again, and the corporal reopened the thick file in front of him. Investigative information pertaining to the murder of the miserable hermit ‘Red’ Tembeck and the theft of the Canadian Maple Leaf gold coins the recluse had hoarded away in his root cellar. Tembeck’s battered and bloodied body had been found behind his ransacked shack of a home out on Rural Route 21, at the entrance to his underground root cellar. The grisly discovery had been made Tuesday morning by the rural mailman. He’d become curious when Tembeck hadn’t been waiting by the side of the road to angrily wave his fist at him as he drove by, as usual. The postie had stopped on the freshly plowed road and eyeballed the hermit’s property from the safety of his truck—and had spotted what appeared to be a body lying in the snow back by the root cellar. He’d then radioed the local RCMP detachment in town. The battered nature of Tembeck’s body and the torn-apart nature of his home seemed to indicate that the murderer had been searching for something, trying to force Tembeck to reveal something—like where his treasure was hidden. Corporal Prescott and Constable Marchildon had found snowshoe tracks running from the road into Tembeck’s property and snowmobile tread tracks running alongside the road. This indicated to the RCMP officers that the murdering thief had wanted to catch Tembeck by surprise by quietly snowshoeing onto the man’s acreage rather than roaring in on a snowmobile. As all of the tracks were still clearly visible, and the frozen body was only covered with a trace of snow, it was safe to assume that the murder and theft had taken place after the snowstorm ended on Sunday night, but before the roads were cleared Monday night. The snowshoe tracks were unique in no way other than their actual depth in the snow, which was rather shallow. And the snowmobile tread tracks were even less revealing—they merged with a popular snowmobile trail through the woods farther down the road, which had already been heavily used again by Tuesday morning, leaving that trail cold, in every sense of the word. Still, the RCMP’s investigation over the past three days had quickly narrowed the suspect field down to a likely four candidates. The small population of the town and surrounding area had helped considerably to narrow the search. It would’ve been extremely unlikely that some random stranger to the area would have been out snowmobiling shortly after a major snowstorm, with a pair of snowshoes conveniently handy, and the knowledge of Red Tembeck’s hidden stash of gold coins. Corporal Prescott scratched his bristly red mustache and thumbed through the investigation file until he came to Grieve Collier’s statement. Collier was an old-timer, slight and sprightly. His property directly bordered Tembeck’s. The two had once been friends and then become mortal enemies, after Tembeck had chased Collier’s young grandchildren away with a loaded shotgun when they’d inadvertently strayed onto his land. Collier admitted that Tembeck had once shown him his gold horde in the root cellar, back in the days when they’d been pals. The RCMP officer blew his nose, flipped over some more pages to Bryan Durell, physical education teacher at the local school and all-around outdoorsman. A trim, athletic man of thirty-two, he’d only come to town about six months earlier—after leaving behind some serious financial troubles in Toronto. Durell had no known grudge with Tembeck. But he did admit to hearing rumors about Tembeck’s gold, although he claimed to have no idea where it had been hidden. A series of expletives in angry Quebecois French suddenly burst from the other side of Prescott’s office door. The Corporal smiled. That would be Jacques Bourbonne, murder and theft suspect #3. The burly, three-hundred-pound lumberjack/fisherman had a fearsome temper that could explode like an axe blade crashing into a tree trunk and then pass just as quickly as a snow squall. Bourbonne had recently been logging in the timber just behind Tembeck’s isolated property. Tembeck had ferociously denounced the man for cutting so close to his land and for making so much noise with his chainsaw. Bourbonne had just as fiercely denounced the other man, before shrugging it off and going on about his business. Until a couple of days later when he’d been ripping into a tree and hit a metal spike with his chainsaw blade. The high-speed metal-on-metal impact had blown the blade apart and sent shrapnel flying everywhere; the big lumberjack only narrowly and luckily avoiding serious injury. It had taken four RCMP officers to pull the furious logger off of Tembeck, who he was sure had deliberately spiked the tree. Corporal Prescott shook his head and flipped to the last few ‘suspect’ pages in the file. Ruth Majick was the owner of the Backwoods Café in town. She was the one-time wife of Red Tembeck, before Tembeck had withdrawn from the world into his bitter ball of hate. The fifty-eight-year-old woman knew all about the gold coins, and it just so happened that her café was facing foreclosure from the bank at the end of the month—unless she could somehow come up with the money to pay off her three missed mortgage payments. Prescott closed the file and stared out the window again. And this time the dazzling scenery didn’t blind the officer. Instead, it enlightened him. He pushed back from his desk and jumped to his feet, resolutely strode to the door and flung it open. Ruth Majick gaped at the big, mustached man. She’d been painfully making her way down the narrow hallway towards the last remaining empty chair along the wall, where Grieve Collier, Bryan Durell and Jacques Bourbonne were already sitting. “How’s the lumbago, Ruth?” Prescott asked good-naturedly. “Terrible—my back’s been acting up all week!” the woman replied, limping along the corridor, a crutch clutched under her right arm. “Well,” Corporal Prescott addressed the group, rubbing his huge hands together with satisfaction, “I want to thank everybody for coming in. But I’ll only need to detain one of you from here on out.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Motive\n• Grieve Collier – Old feud, but he already knew the coins were in the root-cellar.  If he had wanted them he could have gone straight to the hiding place; he would not need to smash up the cabin looking for them.  \n• Ruth Majick – Needs money for the failing café, but chronic lumbago and a crutch make an arduous snow-shoe approach and a violent beating highly improbable.  \n• Jacques Bourbonne – Angry about the spiked tree, yet his fury was momentary.  Theft of gold is out-of-character, and at nearly 300 lb his snow-shoe prints would have been very deep.  \n• Bryan Durell – Heavy personal debts back in Toronto; he has heard the rumours but does not know where the treasure is hidden.  Stealing the coins solves his problem.\n\n2. Opportunity\nMurder must have occurred between the end of the storm Sunday night and before the roads were ploughed Monday night.  \nAll four could in principle be in the area, but only an agile outdoorsman could:\n • operate a snow-mobile,  \n • carry snow-shoes,  \n • walk in on the shoes without being seen,  \n • subdue the victim, ransack the cabin, drag the body to the cellar.  \nDurell, the 32-year-old physical-education teacher and expert outdoorsman, fits this requirement best.\n\n3. Physical evidence\n• Cabin ransacked – killer did NOT know the hiding place.  Collier and Ruth DID know, so it is not them.  \n• Shallow snow-shoe prints – indicates a comparatively light individual.  Bourbonne’s 300 lb frame would leave deep holes; Ruth, with a crutch, would have left an odd gait.  Durell is light and athletic.  \n• Violent beating – needs strength; that eliminates Ruth and the elderly Collier, leaving only Durell and Bourbonne.  The shallow prints eliminate Bourbonne.\n\n4. Deduction\nOnly one person has (a) a pressing motive, (b) the physical capacity, (c) ignorance of the exact hiding place and therefore a need to ransack the cabin, and (d) a body-weight consistent with the prints.  That person is Bryan Durell.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nGrieve Collier, Ruth Majick, Jacques Bourbonne, Bryan Durell\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nBryan Durell\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nLate Sunday night, after the blizzard stopped, Bryan Durell loaded his snow-mobile, strapped a pair of snow-shoes to it and headed out Rural Route 21.  He left the machine on the roadside where its tracks later merged with the public trail, then quietly snow-shoed across the field to Tembeck’s shack, hoping to surprise the hermit and make him reveal the hoard.\n\nInside, Durell threatened and beat Tembeck, overturning furniture and ripping up floorboards in an unsuccessful search.  When that failed, he forced the battered man outside, making him lead the way to the underground root-cellar.  At the entrance an attempted escape or renewed refusal caused Durell to strike again; the final blows killed Tembeck.\n\nDurell then broke open the cellar, located the cache of Maple-Leaf gold coins, packed them into his rucksack, retraced his own snow-shoe trail to the road, lashed the loot onto the snow-mobile and drove off, blending his tread marks into the already-used main trail through the woods.  He was back in town before dawn Monday, and lay low until the body was discovered Tuesday.  He assumed the storm and the busy snow-mobile trail would erase the evidence, but the depth of his prints and the condition of the cabin betrayed him.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Grieve Collier – Knew the precise location of the coins; therefore he would not have ransacked the shack.  Scene evidence contradicts his involvement.  \n• Ruth Majick – Her bad back and reliance on a crutch make snow-shoe travel across deep snow and the severe beating of a healthy man physically impossible.  \n• Jacques Bourbonne – Would have left very deep, unmistakable snow-shoe prints.  The prints found were shallow, eliminating someone of his mass.  Moreover, the motive was anger, not theft; the coins were taken.  \n\nThus only Bryan Durell fits every fact.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

Then he set his steely grey eyes on the remaining man. “Bryan Durell, you’re under arrest for the murder of Red Tembeck and the theft of his Maple Leaf gold coins.”\nDurell sprang out of his chair and raced for the exit before the extended leg of Corporal Marchildon sent the man sprawling.\n“How’d you know it was Bryan?” Grieve Collier asked the Corporal, once Durell had been safely locked away in a holding cell.\nPrescott waggled his mustache. “Simple. There would’ve been no reason for you to ransack Tembeck’s place if you wanted his coins—because you knew where they were. And Ruth Majick was neither physically capable of beating up her ex-husband nor snowshoeing onto his property. And since the shallow depth of those snowshoe tracks indicated a person of relatively slim build, that let big Jacques Bourbonne off the hook.\n“Bryan Durell had the motive—some unresolved financial problems in Toronto—and the muscle to actually do the damage to Tembeck and his home. Which he had to do, because although he knew about the gold coins, he had no idea where they were hidden.”\n“I see,” Grieve Collier said, nodding his head.\nCorporal Prescott puffed out his chest. “We always get our man, Mr. Collier,” he proudly stated. “Rest assured.”"
