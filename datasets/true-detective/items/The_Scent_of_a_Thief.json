      "content": "Detective Cheryl Barnes shook her head at her partner, Robert Simmons. “I can't smell a thing.” “Great,” he replied. “Your allergies act up on the day we investigate a robbery at a perfume company.” The pair drove into the parking lot of Rosewood Perfumes. Robert took a look around while Cheryl talked to the owner, Mr. Walters, a short man with a sad expression on his face. He wore a tie with a four-leaf clover and rubbed a rabbit’s foot with one of his hands. “I’m so glad you’re here,” the man said softly. “How much money was stolen?” asked Cheryl. “None.” “None? But you called in a robbery.” “They stole something more valuable -- perfume.” “Oh? How many bottles?” “One vial.” Cheryl stared at the man, wondering whether he was sane. “That’s it? Maybe you could explain a little bit?” “I can’t. I’m too upset. I’d suggest you talk to my secretary, Betty.” Cheryl nodded and walked over to Betty Simpson’s desk. Betty appeared a moment later with a donut and coffee. Cheryl noticed that she was middle-aged and walked with a limp. “I feel so sorry for Mr. Walters,” Betty said. He’s such a nice man. I had trouble finding a job a few years back, and even though I didn’t have any experience, Mr. Walters made me his secretary.” “Does he always carry a rabbit’s foot?” “Yes, he’s very superstitious. Up on his wall, he has two horseshoes. Before he starts each day, he rubs both of them.” “Maybe you can tell me a bit more about the stolen vial.” “I don’t know too much. But Mr. Walters and the staff have been working on a special perfume. This morning, a vial of it went missing. He doesn’t want to believe that a staff member took it. He thinks of us as family.” Cheryl nodded. “When was the missing vial noticed?” “When I came in -- around eight o’clock -- I heard everyone talking about it. “What time did you leave last night?” “Around six.” “When does Mr. Walters go home for the day?” “Normally, the same time as me. But last night, he had an appointment to see Mr. Danby at eight.” “Oh?” Cheryl removed a pad from her pocket and wrote the name down. “Who is he?” “A competitor in the perfume industry.” “A competitor? Why would Mr. Walters want to speak to him?” “They have a friendly rivalry. Every few months or so, Mr. Danby comes by to boast about his new product line or find out about ours. He runs a super-successful company himself. Cheryl nodded, then wrote something down on her pad. “If I wanted to find out more about your new perfume, whom would I speak with?” “Darlene. She’s Mr. Walters' assistant.” A few moments later, Cheryl entered the laboratory and stood next to Darlene Herman, a tall, broad-shouldered woman. “Can you tell me about your latest project?” Cheryl asked. “Certainly.” Darlene pointed to the glass vials sitting on a wall shelf, numbered from one to twenty. “They contain samples of our newest scent: Intrigue.” Cheryl removed one of the perfume vials and examined it closely. “They look like they're full of water.” “Yes, but they actually contain pheromones” “Pheromones?” asked Cheryl. “Those are the chemicals that make us more attractive to the opposite sex.” “Interesting.” “It's going to triple our sales.” Darlene smiled ear to ear. “You seem very excited about it. Do you get a percentage if it’s successful?” “No, unfortunately not. But Mr. Walters said because of all the hard work I’d put in, he’d give me a promotion once it reaches the market.” “Was it you who noticed that a vial was missing?” “Yes. Due to Mr. Walters’ superstitious nature, we always make sure that there are two number fourteens and no number thirteen. But now there’s a thirteen and only one fourteen. That’s how I knew something was wrong.” “So someone took one out and switched another in?” “Yes, from those empty vials over there.” Darlene pointed to several vials on the table. Cheryl made another note on her pad. “Is there anyone else I can talk to?” Darlene thought a moment. “Perhaps, the janitor. That’s Mr. Harrison. He might have seen something.” A few moments later, Cheryl spoke to the curly-haired janitor. He was a tall man who wore thick, black eye glasses. “How long have you been working here, Mr. Harrison?” “Just a short time. They hired me a few days ago. But I've already given my notice.” Cheryl raised her eyebrows. “So soon?” “Yes. I've heard they've had several janitors leave. It's not a friendly place.” The janitor shook his head. “It’s unbelievable. I'm a professional. They don’t have to tell me what to do. These people make their money the easy way … a desk job. I have to work like a horse.” “I see. What time did you begin cleaning the lab floor last night?” “About 7:30 p.m.” “Did you see Mr. Walters?” Cheryl asked. “Yeah. Just as I went into the lab, he left. I didn't say anything to him and he didn't say anything to me.” “Thank you. That's all I need to know.” The janitor grunted and left the office. Cheryl walked out into the hall and called her partner over. “I think I know who stole the vial.” “You do?” She nodded. “Even with allergies, I can still sniff out a thief.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1.  Establish what was taken  \n    • A single vial of the new perfume “Intrigue.”  \n    • It was originally labeled “14.”  The thief substituted an empty vial filled with water and wrote “13” on it.  \n\n2.  What is the decisive clue?  \n    • Everyone who has worked at Rosewood for any length of time knows Mr. Walters is super-stitious: two “14” vials are kept and the number “13” never appears.  \n    • Therefore, anyone familiar with the lab would never dream of introducing a “13” label.  \n    • Only someone ignorant of the quirk would make that mistake.\n\n3.  Who knew / did not know about the superstition?  \n    • Walters – yes.  \n    • Betty (secretary) – yes (she discussed horseshoes, rabbit’s foot, etc.).  \n    • Darlene (assistant chemist) – yes (she explained the double-14 rule to the detective).  \n    • Mr. Danby – as a friendly rival of long standing, he very likely knows Walters’s odd habits.  \n    • Mr. Harrison (janitor) – hired “a few days ago,” claims nobody talks to him, complains the place is “not friendly.”  Absolutely nothing suggests he had been told about the superstition.\n\n4.  Motive analysis  \n    • Walters: no motive to steal his own product.  \n    • Betty: desperately wants to keep job; theft risks that.  \n    • Darlene: a promotion is coming if perfume succeeds; no gain from stealing it.  \n    • Danby: already “super-successful,” could easily buy or duplicate; but no direct evidence he entered lab.  \n    • Harrison: feels unappreciated, quitting anyway, sees a valuable vial that could be sold to competitor.  Clear motive.\n\n5.  Opportunity & time line  \n    18:00  – Betty, Darlene and most staff leave.  \n    19:30  – Harrison begins cleaning the lab.  He alone is inside.  \n    19:30  – Walters finishes some work in lab and walks out; Harrison sees him leave.  \n    Between 19:30-20:00 – Harrison has free run of the laboratory before Walters’s 20:00 meeting.  Perfect window to grab a vial, copy the handwriting “13,” and walk off.  \n\n6.  Logical deduction  \n    • The person must be (a) unaware of the superstition and (b) physically present in the lab after others left.  \n    • Only Harrison satisfies both conditions.  Ergo, he stole the vial.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nBetty Simpson, Darlene Herman, Mr. Danby, Mr. Walters, Carl Harrison\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nCarl Harrison (the janitor)\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nAfter most employees left at 6 PM, Carl Harrison continued his janitorial rounds.  \nAt 7:30 PM he entered the laboratory just as Mr. Walters was leaving to meet Mr. Danby.  \nSeeing twenty identical vials and realizing they contained the top-secret perfume, Harrison pocketed one marked “14,” intending to sell or barter it later.  \nTo hide the disappearance he took an empty vial from a nearby bench, filled it with tap water, wrote “13” on the label and slid it into the rack.  \nBecause he had only been on the job a few days, he did not know that no item in the building is ever numbered “13.”  \nThe next morning Darlene immediately spotted a “13” vial and the missing “14,” triggering the investigation.  \nHarrison, the only person unaware of the superstition and the only one with both motive and opportunity, is therefore the thief.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\n• Mr. Walters – Owner and victim; his fortune depends on launching “Intrigue,” not losing it.  \n\n• Betty Simpson – Values her rare job opportunity, left the building at 6 PM, and knows the superstition so would never insert a “13.”  \n\n• Darlene Herman – Awaits a promotion tied to the perfume’s success; exposing the scent early would ruin that.  Also left with the other staff and is fully aware of the double-14 convention.  \n\n• Mr. Danby – Arrived only for an 8 PM meeting, would have to bypass Walters and the janitor, and, as another industry leader, has easier (and legal) routes to acquire a sample.  Most importantly, he, too, has known Walters for years and would know never to use the number 13.  \n\nOnly Carl Harrison lacked any knowledge of the superstition, had an open thirty-minute window in the laboratory, expressed dissatisfaction with his job, and produced the tell-tale “13” labeling error.  Hence, the other suspects are cleared.\n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

She probably knows all the company secrets.”\nCheryl shook her head. “No, I don’t think so. She had trouble finding a job. So she wouldn’t do anything that would make her lose this one.”\n“OK, what about Darlene? She was in the lab with all the vials. It would have been very easy for her to take one out and switch another in.”\nCheryl shook her head. “No way. She knew all about Mr. Walters’ superstitions. She definitely wouldn’t have written the number thirteen on any of the vials.”\nRobert scratched his head. “I’ve got it. The mysterious Mr. Danby. He could have gone to the lab after his meeting with Walters.”\n“I don’t think so. He has no motive. He’s already so successful.”\nRobert sighed, “I give up.”\nCheryl smiled. “Mr. Harrison is the thief.”\n“Harrison? How do you figure that?”\n“Everyone else knew about Mr. Walters’ superstitious nature except him -- he’d just been hired and no one talked to him. He grabbed the fourteenth vial, not realizing there were two fourteens. Then he looked at the rest of the vials and it appeared number thirteen was missing. So he grabbed an empty one, filled it with water and wrote thirteen on it. Then he placed it with the other vials.”\nRobert stared at her for a moment, then laughed. “Maybe I’d be able to solve more crimes if I had allergies too.”"
