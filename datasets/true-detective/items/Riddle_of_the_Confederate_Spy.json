      "content": "Cannons fired in Maryland, as 45,000 Confederate soldiers crossed the Potomac River, \napproaching Washington, D.C. But far away in Illinois, a lonely Union sergeant performed his own duty – guarding a secluded stretch of railroad tracks against sabotage. It had only been one week, and already he missed home. That night, the sergeant’s troubled eyes searched the sky for answers, while the campfire cast shadows on the faces of four soldiers who accompanied him. “You're all good soldiers,” Sergeant Stoker said, fondly. “Unfortunately, one of you is a spy.” Then, the sergeant held up a bundle of dynamite. “This was on the bridge,” he said, his eyes searching the faces surrounding the campfire. “Without that bridge, the railroad can't continue on to Pennsylvania. Those Confederate soldiers attacking Maryland right now would like to stop our supplies from getting through. So much so, it seems, that they've snuck a saboteur into our unit.” The soldiers were far from the war's front lines, and yet such an integral part of the effort. A single bundle of dynamite could leave the troops ill-equipped and ineffective, changing the outcome of the crucial battles to come, and maybe even the war itself. The future of the United States was at stake. And now, an enemy spy was among them. A man they had worked with, talked with, and come to trust over the first week of guarding the railroad bridge. But how had the sergeant known? “There's no one else near this bridge for miles,” the sergeant said, wearily, “and no way to approach it without being seen. Unfortunately, I don't know any of you. Each of you arrived some time during this week, each saying you'd been sent here by your regiment's office.” He paced around the fire, “And, unfortunately – one of you is lying.” What was going through the sergeant's head? Why would he brandish the incriminating dynamite in front of every solider? Did he want to frighten the suspect, or was it a clever trick? Did the sergeant hope the spy would run away? Well, there was no such luck, and the situation quickly became dire. Could the soldiers sleep that night knowing one among them was an enemy? To determine the spy’s identity would take careful reflection and wit. “Each of you arrived here carrying a back pack,” he continued, “which could easily conceal a bundle of dynamite.” The men looked at each other uneasily. “Winslow,” the sergeant suddenly shouted, “Who's the President of the United States.” “Abraham Lincoln,” Winslow answered, suspiciously. “Were you hoping he'd say Jefferson Davis,” joked a soldier named Parker. “Then you'd know he was a Confederate rebel sticking dynamite under our bridge for sure!” “There are other ways,” said Sergeant Stoker. An owl hooted in the night. Sergeant Stoker scanned the four soldiers thoughtfully, and then finally asked, slowly, “Who arrived here first?” “I did,” said Parker, “followed by McMurty, then Winslow and finally Garret.” “I would've got here first,” insisted Garrett, “but my horse was lazy.” “Was your horse lazy, Garrett – or were you!” joked Parker. The soldiers laughed, relieved for a moment to break the tension. “And where is it that each of you is sleeping?” Stoker continued. “Under that tree,” said Garrett. “It blocks the sun when it comes up in the morning.” “In front of that bush,” answered Winslow, still suspicious. “Beside the campfire,” answered McMurty. “I'm always cold!” “Behind that rock,” said Parker. “So I can watch for Confederate spies!” “Refresh my memory,” said the sergeant casually, “What states were you sent here from?” “Ohio,” said Garrett. “I left just before harvest time came for our family's corn crop.” “So's he wouldn't have to work!” joked Parker. “I came from West Virginia where I log the incoming ships at a receiving house.” “Indiana,” said Winslow, very suspicious now. “I was working in my father's blacksmith shop.” “Illinois,” said McMurty. “I had an apprenticeship at a printer's shop.” “That settles it,” said Sergeant Stoker. He stood up from the campfire, and then returned, sternly carrying a pair of iron handcuffs. “I think I know which man should be wearing these.”",

McMurty was the most relieved of all, “But then who is the spy?” he asked\n“Fact is … if I had a pack full of dynamite, I don't reckon I'd want to sleep in plain sight at all. Especially if I wanted to slip away some night and plant dynamite on the railroad bridge.” The men thought for a moment, as Sergeant Stoker continued his narrative. “I wouldn't sleep in front of a bush. And I wouldn't sleep out in the open under a tree. But behind a rock ...”\n“Now wait a minute,” said Parker. But Sergeant Stoker smiled, and held up a finger to quiet him.\n“It's mighty strange that you arrived in Illinois first,” Sergeant Stoker said to Parker. “… Since you said you were travelling the furthest – all the way from West Virginia.”\n“I rode like the devil,” Parker insisted. “I didn't want to miss my chance to lend a hand!”\nSergeant Stoker nodded his head slowly, but then furrowed his brow. “I've only been stationed here for one week myself,” said Sergeant Stoker. “That doesn't seem like enough time for the West Virginia Army to send you on a 600-mile cross-country trip, all the way to Illinois.”\n“They received a telegraph,” said Parker quickly. “And my horse travels fast!”\n“85 miles a day?” asked Sergeant Stoker. “Even the best horses can't manage more than 50.”\nParker insisted his story was true, but Sergeant Stoker interrupted. “I believe you when you say that you logged the incoming ships at a receiving house. But I don't believe it was in West Virginia. … West Virginia doesn't touch the ocean.”\nParker looked around nervously at the faces of the other soldiers.\n“You probably did work at a ship's receiving house,” the sergeant continued. “But Winfield Scott put a stop to that.” We all laughed. The Union's commanding general had enacted an “Anaconda” strategy, blocking all ships headed for the Confederacy. “I bet that left you with a lot of time on your hands. And a lot of reasons to want to put dynamite on our railroad bridge.”\n“You can't be sure of this,” Parker shouted. “For all you know, you're about to arrest a loyal Union soldier.”\n“I'm sure,” said Sergeant Stoker, “and here's why.”\n“I never said the dynamite was under the bridge. I said it was on the bridge. But when you made your joke about Jefferson Davis, you said our rebel spy was sticking dynamite under our bridges. You're right, of course. But there's only one way you could've known where our spy was sticking his dynamite.”\nRelief crossed Sergeant's Stoker's face, and for the first time that night, he smiled. “I'm sorry to spoil the campfire,” the sergeant said jovially. “Console yourself with the thought that someday, this war will be over, and we'll all be fellow country men again.”\n“ … But until then – you're under arrest.”",

          "solution": "<THOUGHT PROCESS>\n1. Establish who had a reason to injure the Union cause.  \n   • Only Parker’s own words supply a motive: he claims to “log the incoming ships at a receiving-house.”  The Union blockade (“Anaconda Plan”) has virtually stopped all Southern maritime traffic, so a Confederate sympathizer who worked that job would be unemployed and resentful—perfect motive for sabotage.\n\n2. Test each man’s story against geography and logistics.  \n   • Garrett – From Ohio, a short ride to Illinois; nothing illogical.  \n   • Winslow – From Indiana, next–door state; again plausible.  \n   • McMurty – From Illinois itself; entirely plausible.  \n   • Parker – Says he left “West Virginia” (600 mi away) yet reached the bridge first, inside a single week.  A messenger horse averages ≤50 mi/day; 600 mi needs at least 12 days.  His tale is impossible.\n\n   In addition, “logging incoming ships” cannot be done in West Virginia; the state is land-locked.  Parker’s résumé therefore is a fabrication.\n\n3. Consider opportunity and behaviour at camp.  \n   • Where would a man sleep if his pack contained dynamite and he might need to slip away at night?  Behind a boulder, hidden from view—the very place Parker chooses.  \n   • A saboteur would not bed down next to a camp-fire (McMurty) that might ignite his explosives, nor directly under a sunrise tree (Garrett) or in open view in front of a bush (Winslow).\n\n4. Look for inadvertent admissions.  \n   Sergeant Stoker never specified where on the bridge the dynamite sat; he only said “ON the bridge.”  \n   Yet Parker jokes the saboteur was “sticking dynamite UNDER our bridge.”  \n   Only the person who actually put it there would know its true position.\n\n5. Aggregate: impossible travel time, false biography, best hiding spot, slip-of-the-tongue about where the dynamite lay.  All evidence converges on Parker.\n</THOUGHT PROCESS>\n\n<SUSPECTS>\nParker, Garrett, Winslow, McMurty\n</SUSPECTS>\n\n<CULPRIT>\nParker\n</CULPRIT>\n\n<EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\nOrdered south by Confederate handlers, Parker pretended to be a Union volunteer.  \nHe rode partway by rail and partway on horseback, arriving at the isolated Illinois bridge before the other three sentries.  Beneath cover of night he crawled UNDER the trestle and lashed a bundle of dynamite to a support beam, planning to place a second bundle later and ignite both.  \n\nWhen Sergeant Stoker unexpectedly inspected the bridge, he discovered the first bundle and realised the saboteur had to be among his four recent arrivals.  \n\nDuring the fireside interrogation Parker betrayed himself repeatedly:  \n• claiming an impossible seven-day, 600-mile ride from West Virginia;  \n• inventing a seaport job in a land-locked state;  \n• choosing the one sleeping spot (behind a rock) that gave him concealment and quick access to the bridge;  \n• blurting the word “under” when no one had mentioned the dynamite’s exact placement.\n\nThose slips confirmed the sergeant’s suspicions.  Stoker produced handcuffs and arrested Parker before further damage could be done.\n</EVENT RECONSTRUCTION>\n\n<WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>\nGarrett – Ohio is close; his story about missing corn harvest is mundane but believable, and his sleeping spot (under a tree in plain sight) is ill-suited to a man hiding explosives.  Nothing he says is contradicted by fact.  \n\nWinslow – From Indiana, a neighbouring state; journey time fits the sergeant’s own arrival schedule.  He never displays forbidden knowledge about the bridge, and he sleeps openly before a bush.  \n\nMcMurty – Local Illinois printer’s apprentice; logistics perfect.  Most telling, no saboteur would risk sleeping right beside a fire with a pack that supposedly contains dynamite.  Stoker dismisses him early for that very reason.  \n\nThus only Parker had false background, impossible travel, concealed vantage point, motive, and incriminating foreknowledge.  \n</WHY THE OTHER SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT>",

McMurty was the most relieved of all, “But then who is the spy?” he asked\n“Fact is … if I had a pack full of dynamite, I don't reckon I'd want to sleep in plain sight at all. Especially if I wanted to slip away some night and plant dynamite on the railroad bridge.” The men thought for a moment, as Sergeant Stoker continued his narrative. “I wouldn't sleep in front of a bush. And I wouldn't sleep out in the open under a tree. But behind a rock ...”\n“Now wait a minute,” said Parker. But Sergeant Stoker smiled, and held up a finger to quiet him.\n“It's mighty strange that you arrived in Illinois first,” Sergeant Stoker said to Parker. “… Since you said you were travelling the furthest – all the way from West Virginia.”\n“I rode like the devil,” Parker insisted. “I didn't want to miss my chance to lend a hand!”\nSergeant Stoker nodded his head slowly, but then furrowed his brow. “I've only been stationed here for one week myself,” said Sergeant Stoker. “That doesn't seem like enough time for the West Virginia Army to send you on a 600-mile cross-country trip, all the way to Illinois.”\n“They received a telegraph,” said Parker quickly. “And my horse travels fast!”\n“85 miles a day?” asked Sergeant Stoker. “Even the best horses can't manage more than 50.”\nParker insisted his story was true, but Sergeant Stoker interrupted. “I believe you when you say that you logged the incoming ships at a receiving house. But I don't believe it was in West Virginia. … West Virginia doesn't touch the ocean.”\nParker looked around nervously at the faces of the other soldiers.\n“You probably did work at a ship's receiving house,” the sergeant continued. “But Winfield Scott put a stop to that.” We all laughed. The Union's commanding general had enacted an “Anaconda” strategy, blocking all ships headed for the Confederacy. “I bet that left you with a lot of time on your hands. And a lot of reasons to want to put dynamite on our railroad bridge.”\n“You can't be sure of this,” Parker shouted. “For all you know, you're about to arrest a loyal Union soldier.”\n“I'm sure,” said Sergeant Stoker, “and here's why.”\n“I never said the dynamite was under the bridge. I said it was on the bridge. But when you made your joke about Jefferson Davis, you said our rebel spy was sticking dynamite under our bridges. You're right, of course. But there's only one way you could've known where our spy was sticking his dynamite.”\nRelief crossed Sergeant's Stoker's face, and for the first time that night, he smiled. “I'm sorry to spoil the campfire,” the sergeant said jovially. “Console yourself with the thought that someday, this war will be over, and we'll all be fellow country men again.”\n“ … But until then – you're under arrest.”"
