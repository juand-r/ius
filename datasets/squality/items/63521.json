Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\nnarl\nlast night when it attacked you.\"\n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\nNoork\nAt first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n\"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Raiders of the Second Moon, by Gene Ellerman\n\n",

With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.  He fights the priest, kills him, and frees Sarna.  They go back to the field, get Rold, and the three of them flee into the jungle.  They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle."

                "response_text": "Noork, a man from Earth who doesn’t remember who he is, lives in the jungle on a second moon. He knows he was brought there by what he remembers as a huge bird and that he was taken in by a man named Gurn and the Vasad people of the jungle. He meets a woman named Sarna with whom he shares a mutual attraction, and it turns out that she is Gurn’s sister. Shortly after they discover this, they are attacked. Sarna vanishes and Noork hides, eventually discovering that the “Misty Ones” who attacked them, thought to be demons, look similar to him and can be “skinned”; this is important because their skins or coverings allow the wearer to be nearly invisible like them. \n\nNoork passes a message along via another Vasad to tell Gurn what he has learned about the Misty Ones, and to say that Noork has gone to rescue Sarna. He sneaks into the walled temple where the slaves are being kept, and enlists the help of another slave, Rold, to help them get out if he can get Sarna. Noork goes down to the cavern and, after fighting a priest to the death, rescues Sarna. They escape with Rold, only to be captured by more Misty Ones, one of whom turns out to be a Nazi from Noork’s previous life. \n\nThough Noork can’t remember him (but knows he dislikes him), Doctor Von Mark remembers him. Noork’s name was Stephen Dietrich, and he was an American flier who had chased down one of the last nazi criminals: Doctor Von Mark. Von Mark had then flown one of his shuttles to Sekk and landed successfully, while Stephen had pursued him in another of his shuttles and crashed on Sekk, resulting in his amnesia. “Noork” was the name given to him by the Vasad based on the only sounds he could make: “New York”. \n\nDoctor Von Mark asks if Noork knows the secret to the invisibility of the Misty One’s skins, since this would allow him to return to Earth and take it over for the Fatherland. When he realizes that Noork knows nothing, he moves to kill him but is shot by an arrow just in time. Gurn has rallied warriors based on Noork’s message. Noork now knows his real name and that he got where he is by hunting down an evil man. He is now happy to live safely in the jungle with Gurn and Sarna, and she says she is happy, too. \n"

Dietrich followed Von Mark to Africa where Von Mark took off in a spaceship, and Dietrich followed. Both landed on Sekk, a second moon past Luna, but Dietrich’s landing was so rough that he lost his memory. When the locals found him, he said, “New York,” which they didn’t understand and named him Noork. Noork lives among the Vasads and learns their language. \n\nNoork and Tholon Sarna meet in the jungle and become friends. One day as they are talking, Noork hears feet scuffing, and Tholon disappears. Noork climbs a tree to find out where the Misty Ones are (They are invisible.). He detects movement and throws overripe fruit, which stains the cloaks of the Misty Ones. Noork shoots arrows toward the creatures and kills one. He takes that one’s robe, which is what makes the Misty Ones invisible. \n\nNoork tells one of his colleagues to take the message to Gurn, their leader and Tholon’s brother, that the Misty Ones are flesh and blood, not demons as they believe. He tells Ud that he is going to the island of the Misty Ones to save Tholon. He reaches the wall surrounding the Misty Ones’ village and overhears two slaves talking before they separate. Noork approaches the slave in the field, Rold, and asks for his help in exchange for helping Rold escape. Rold explains that the large skull is the god Uzdon, and the priests make sacrifices by taking the heart out of a living slave girl. He also tells Noork that the slave girls are held in a pit beneath the skull guarded by Misty Ones.\n\nNoork moves among the Misty Ones in anonymity since he is wearing one of their robes. He enters the skull and kills the guards who are in charge of the slave girls. Just as he is about to release Tholon, a priest catches him, and they fight until Noork kills him, too. Noork takes more robes and the priest’s face shield and leaves with Tholon and Rold. The face shield enables him to see the Misty Ones who are invisible to everyone else, so he can see when they are waiting to trap them. They capture the escape party, and one of the Misty Ones reveals that he is Dr. Von Mark after recognizing Dietrich. Von Mark reveals his plans to use the cloaks of invisibility to conquer Earth and make Germany invincible. Von Mark prepares to shoot Dietrich but is shot by an arrow first. Misty Ones close in on the group and lower their hoods, revealing Tholon’s brother Gurn and his men. Noork now remembers who he is and says he will live in peace with Gurn and his sister.\n"

He repeated the word \"New York\", and so the Vasads call him Noork. From his perch, he now watches a girl—Tholon Sarna--moving along a trail below. She is the sister of Gurn, the Vasad leader. Gurn has been exiled from their home city of Grath because he doesn't believe in the enslavement of the Zuran, and Tholon Sarna has recently evaded capture by her enemies, the men of Konto. The Misty Ones--slavers dwellling at the Temple of the Skull and feared deeply by the Vasads--follow her. As Tholon Sarna and Noork walk, she is captured by a Misty One made invisible by a special robe. A Misty One clubs Noork, injuring his arm. Thanks to their blurry outlines, Noork realizes the Misty Ones are not entirely invisible, and he uses his legs to pelt them with fruit. Upon seeing their true form--closer to his own human shape--Noork loses his fear of them and begins attacking them with arrows. He takes the invisibility robe of a fallen Misty One and uses it to disguise himself as he makes his way to the Temple of the Skull. Along the way, he reunites with his friend Ud, a jungle-dwelling beast-man. He sends Ud to inform Gurn of the Misty Ones' newfound weakness. We then learn that Noork's real name is Stephen Dietrich, and he had been hunting Dr. Karl Von Mark, a criminal scientist attempting to revivify the Nazi power structure. Von Mark manages to evade Dietrich by landing on Sekk, and Dietrich crashes and succumbs to amnesia. The bird that had carried him to the cliff was his own plane, and the bird he had been seeking was Von Mark's. Now, Noork descends upon a slave named Rold near the Temple of the Skull. He enlists Rold to help him free Tholon Sarna. Rold informs Noork of the High Priest's plan to choose a sacrifice to their god, Uzdon, from the female slaves caged in a pit beneath the Skull. Noork promises a robe to Rold if his plan to rescue Tholon Sarna succeeds. In disguise, Noork approaches the Skull, heavily guarded by Misty Ones, and makes his way toward the pit. Along the way, he defeats guards and pockets two robes. Before freeing Tholon Sarna, Noork battles the High Priest, kills him, and they make their escape. Soon after, they are again trapped by a group of Misty Ones--this time led by none other than Dr. Karl Von Mark himself. Von Mark tells Noork of his desire to use the secret of invisibility to make Germany all-powerful, and he pulls out a gun to kill him. Suddenly, Gurn emerges with the Vasads, and they kill Von Mark with arrows. Noork recalls his true identify as Captain Dietrich and looks forward to a life of peace amongst the Vasads with Tholon Sarna."

In this way, it is implied that Sekk is a second moon of Earth.\n\nIn the jungle, we meet Noork and a young woman named Sarna.  They begin traveling together through the jungle, but soon Sarna disappears and Noork is attacked.  This is our first encounter with the Misty Ones, who blend in with the jungle foliage.  Noork defeats the Misty Ones and continues toward the lake and island where they make their home.\n\nNoork briefly encounters his friend Ud near the marshy lowlands that lie between the jungled valleys on Sekk and the central Lake of Uzdon, but this area is not described.  When Noork reaches the central island in the lake, we encounter a non-jungle landscape for the first time.  Noork finds himself in a cultivated field, and sees the shape of a huge white skull about half a mile away.  After speaking with an enslaved man and learning where Sarna is being held, Noork continues toward the skull.\n\nThe skull is a dome of white stone, with black stone for eye-sockets and nose-holes.  The interior contains a raised altar made of precious metals--gold, silver, and brass--and precious stones, as well as stone images of the two gods the Misty Ones worship.  Below the altar is the caged area where the young women are held; Noork detects the entrance to this area by its foul odor.  The room where the young women are kept is dimly lit by only two torches, very damp with pools of dirty water all around, and holds at least twenty young women.  They have nothing to sit on but rotten grass mats.  In contrast to the enslaved men who are out in the cultivated fields and open air, the young women are in a desperate situation indeed.  They can only sit in their foul, rotting prison and wait to be sacrificed."

Some trees are over forty feet tall; Noork uses these trees to surveil the area around him. Several groups live on Sekk in different villages, and there are dangerous wild animals called spotted narls. There is a mysterious group of beings, believed to be demons, called the Misty Ones because they are invisible. They live on an island in the middle of a lake and have a huge skull that represents their god, Uzdon. Female slaves are held captive in a pit beneath the skull.

Deep in this depression is a lake surrounded by twelve vast, green valleys and jungles. The jungles are dense and covered with massive trees that look like giants. Many of these trees have sticky fruits that Noork later uses to help him see the Misty Ones.  Noork paddles across the lake in order to reach the island of Manak, which is home to the Temple of Skull where the Misty Ones make their sacrifices to the gods Uzdon and Lornu. The Temple is comprised mostly of stone, and the sacrificial altar is made of brass, gold, and silver. After navigating through the Temple to find Tholon Sarna, he eventually ends up in “the pit”—a cavern dimly lit with torches and peppered with dark standing water. After their escape from the Temple, they are once again stopped by Misty Ones in a grassy inlet back on the mainland.

Sarna says that her brother says they should no longer enslave Zurans they capture from other valleys.  In this way, their relationships with Gurn build a bridge between them, allowing them to consider a relationship with one another.\n\nGurn is next mentioned when Noork encounters his friend Ud near the central lake of Sekk, the moon they are on.  Noork asks Ud to go to their mutual friend Gurn and pass on a message.  Noork asks Ud to tell Gurn that the Misty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  When Ud wonders why anyone would want to do such a thing, Noork tells him that Noork is trying to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\", as he describes Gurn's sister Sarna.\n\nGurn then arrives as something between a hero and a deus ex machina at the very end of the story.  Noork, Sarna, and Rold, an enslaved man who helped Noork free Sarna, are about to be murdered by Doctor Von Mark and the Misty Ones, when Gurn and his allies arrive and shoot the enemy full of arrows, saving all their lives.  Gurn reveals that he received Ud's messages and they were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across the lake and stealing their robes so they could come to Noork's rescue.

                "response_text": "Enslavement and freedom as themes run throughout the story.  When Noork and Sarna first meet each other in the opening scene, one of the ways they decide to trust one another is because of their mutual relationships with Gurn, a third character.  Gurn has been exiled from the city of Grath because he says that his people should no longer enslave the captured Zurans from other valleys of Sekk.  In the next scene, we learn that Sarna, Gurn's sister, was kidnapped by one group of slavers, escaped them with four others, and only narrowly escaped capture by a second group of slavers, the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull, who captured the other four of her group.  Noork tells her that one day he will visit the island of Misty Ones who took her friends.  At this time, he realizes that Sarna has disappeared, and he is attacked by the Misty Ones, though he is able to fight them off.\n\nDuring Noork's travels to the island of the Misty Ones, we learn his backstory: he is American pilot Stephen Dietrich, and he arrived on the moon of Sekk by following Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Nazi criminals at large.  Dietrich's ship had crashed on Sekk, robbing him of his memory.  In the conflict between the Allies and Nazis, we again see the conflict between enslavement and freedom:  the Nazis forced those they considered racially \"impure\" into prison camps where they were either murdered outright or forced to engage in labor under inhumane conditions until they died; the Allied forces were a hope of freedom for these imprisoned, enslaved people.\n\nNoork spies on enslaved men in the fields outside the temple of the Misty Ones and hears them gossiping about Sarna.  The older man suggests that their life is not so bad, but the younger man protests and states that one day he plans to escape.  Noork approaches the younger man to find out where Sarna is being held and promises to take him along when he and Sarna escape.  Noork then fights off multiple guards and a priest in order to free Sarna from the pit where she is held, which is dank and full of rotting grass mats and little light.\n\nWhile the story touches on themes of enslavement and freedom, it does not engage with them fully.  The dungeon where the enslaved young women is held is described in foul terms, but Noork does not seem to free all the young women from their prison.  That may happen as a result of Gurn's final attack on Doctor Von Mark and the Misty Ones, but Noork escapes only with Sarna and Rold.  Rold is unhappy with being enslaved, not because he is being harmed or others are, but because he is not free to mate with attractive young women like Sarna.  While the story should not need to spell out every reason why enslavement is wrong, it takes a very superficial approach to a deeply painful issue."

Gurn has been exiled for speaking out against the slavery that his people have inflicted on others, which is how he a Noork find one another. Noork’s travels during the action of the story are undertaken in an effort to save Sarna, who has now been enslaved twice. The person he enlists to help him, Rold, is also a slave. When Doctor Von Mark and the Misty Ones ambush Noork and the doctor recognizes him as Stephen Dietrich, he mentions that the trapper has now become the trapped. A moment later, Gurn and the other warriors free Noork from the doctor’s enslavement. Most of the story involves various people being enslaved or feeling a certain way about enslavement, and the element of Nazism in the story also lends it a broader theme of the enslavement that that regime inflicted and tried to inflict, and the continued possession of the Earth that Von Mark is working toward. \n"

His sister, Tholon, was captured by slavers but managed to escape with four others. However, when they passed near the Lake of Uzdon, the Misty Ones captured her four fellow escapees. And while Tholon is telling her story to Noork, she is kidnapped by the Misty Ones and spirited away to their city of Uzdon. The Misty Ones offer beautiful slave girls chosen by their priests as sacrifices to their god Uzdon, binding them to the altar and removing their hearts while still alive. The Misty Ones also enslave others to be workers. Slaves work in their cultivated fields and gardens, and in the skull, slaves are chained together with heavy chains. "

The men of Kanto are enemies of the Vasads and the people of Grath, but the city of Grath also enslaves people. When Gurn speaks out against the practice, he is exiled from Grath and becomes transient with his group of Vasads. When Noork first meets Tholon Sarna, she has fled her initial enslavement, narrowly avoided enslavement by the men of Kanto, and is then captured by the Misty Ones, who also have slaves working on the island of Manak. Noork frees Rold from his enslavement, and enlists his help to prevent Tholon Sarna from becoming a human sacrifice to Uzdon. When the Vasads defeat the Misty Ones and Dr. Von Mark, they are free to live in their own society without the constraints of slavery."

                "response_text": "The Misty Ones are a group of highly feared beings, thought to be supernatural in some way at the beginning of the story because of their ability to remain unseen.  Noork, however, is able to catch a glimpse of the bottom of one of their feet from his vantage point high in a tree and begins to pelt the area where he believes they are with fruit.  After this, he can see their outlines and that they are wearing robes with hoods, and he ceases to be afraid and attacks with arrows, killing one of the Misty Ones.  He disrobes this man, who is described as heavily scarred on his face, having a low forehead, with more hair on his body and less golden skin than other men of Zuran.  Once Noork is sure that the Misty Ones are not supernatural, he decides to pursue them in an attempt to rescue Sarna, sister of his friend Gurn, who has been kidnapped by them.\n\nNoork spreads the word to his friend Ud that the Misty Ones are not demons and can be trapped and skinned and lets Ud know of his rescue mission for Sarna.  He also tells Rold, an enslaved man on the island of the Misty Ones and the priests of Uzdon (the god who demands sacrifice of young women).  Rold decides he will help Noork with his rescue mission in exchange for Noork's promise to rescue him as well--realizing that he is imprisoned by men and not demons has allowed him to dream that he can kill his captors and be free.\n\nWhen Noork fights a priest of Uzdon in order to free Sarna, he learns that the priests not only have the robes of concealment the Misty Ones have, they also have transparent masks that allow them to see through that concealment.  It allows him to anticipate their ambush at the end of the story, though not quite soon enough to stop it.  Gurn, though, has received his message and acted on it.  He has been capturing and \"skinning\" Misty Ones who have crossed the lake and he and his warriors ambush the Misty Ones and priests in return, freeing Noork and his friends.  With the realization that the Misty Ones are men with special cloaks rather than demons with supernatural powers, their mystique evaporates and everyone they have terrorized is willing to attack them.  Characters unwilling to battle demons are unafraid to attack men."

They are creatures that come from the island in the lake of Uzdon, and they look like mist and are therefore nearly invisible to most (other than the priests).

With so little is known about them other than their devious acts, they are considered demons. They live on an island in the Lake of Uzdon and have a giant skull known as the Temple of the Skull that represents their god, Uzdon, to whom they over living female sacrifices. The Misty Ones wear cloaks that make them invisible, and until Noork shoots and kills one with an arrow, no one knows that they are flesh and bone beings underneath their robes. Noork discovers they look very much like he does but with a low, sloping forehead and more body hair. When the Misty Ones kidnap Tholon, Noork notices he can see a foot of one of them because it was covered with mud. He throws overripe fruit at the group, and the fruit stains their cloaks, enabling Noork to see them. The Misty Ones capture girls to be slave sacrifices to their god, but they also capture men who work for them in their fields and gardens and others who move through the skull all chained together. They are led by priests who also wear cloaks that make them invisible and colorful feathers along with a face shield that enables them to see the other Misty Ones in their cloaks. Once Noork discovers that the Misty Ones are like everyone else, the Misty Ones lose the advantage of the fear they engender in others and risk death at their hands.\n"

To complete these sacrifices, they habitually capture and imprison young women from around the land of Zura, and they choose the youngest and most beautiful to sacrifice. The Misty Ones inspire fear in the hearts of the Vasads and other peoples of Zura due to their mysterious nature and their ability to move about invisibly. However, their weakness is revealed when Noork discovers they are not completely invisible after all, and their “skin” (an invisibility robe) can be easily removed. Noork has his friend Ud pass this message along to Gurn and his Vasads to encourage them to no longer fear the Misty Ones. This tactic works, and the Vasads show up just in time to save the day."
