Flowers,\n   \n  had stumbled onto a murderous plot more\n   \n  hair-raising than any she had ever concocted.\n   \n  And the danger from the villain of the piece\n   \n  didn't worry her—I was the guy he was shooting at.\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nI was killing an hour in the billiard room of the\nSpacemen's Club\nin Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the\nshoulder.\n \n  \"Beg pardon, thir,\" he said with his racial lisp, \"thereth thome one to\nthee you in the main lounge.\" His eyes rolled as he added, \"A lady!\"\n \n  A woman here...! The\nSpacemen's\nwas a sanctuary, a rest club where\nin-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another\nvoyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly\nenforced.\n \n  I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main\nlounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.\n \n  Grannie Annie!\n \n  There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning\non her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a\nvoluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,\ntied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were\nplanted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in\ncalm defiance.\n \n  I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. \"Grannie Annie! I\nhaven't seen you in two years.\"\n \n  \"Hi, Billy-boy,\" she greeted calmly. \"Will you please tell this\nfish-face to shut up.\"\n \n  The desk clerk went white. \"Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a\nfriend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely\nagainth the ruleth....\"\n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" I grinned. \"Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no\none there at this hour.\"\n \n  In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us—me a lime rickey\nand Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour—I waited until she had tossed\nthe drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:\n \n  \"What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't\nallowed in the\nSpacemen's\n? What happened to the book you were\nwriting?\"\n \n  \"Hold it, Billy-boy.\" Laughingly she threw up both hands. \"Sure, I knew\nthis place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what\nthey are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.\"\n \n  She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be\nAnnabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.\nBut to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's\nhat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel\nin the name of science fiction than anyone alive.\n \n  But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for\nmore. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers\nsat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.\n \n  One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime\nnovels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a\nnovel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag\nand hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two\nexpeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.\n \n  She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.\n \n  \"What happened to\nGuns for Ganymede\n?\" I asked. \"That was the title of\nyour last, wasn't it?\"\nGrannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly\nrolled herself a cigarette.\n \n  \"It wasn't\nGuns\n, it was\nPistols\n; and it wasn't\nGanymede\n, it was\nPluto\n.\"\n \n  I grinned. \"All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe\nand beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.\"\n \n  \"What else is there in science fiction?\" she demanded. \"You can't have\nyour hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.\"\n \n  Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her\nfeet.\n \n  \"I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the\nSatellite\nTheater in ten\nminutes. Come on, you're going with me.\"\n \n  Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to\nthe jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we\ndrew up before the big doors of the\nSatellite\n.\n \n  They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled\ncolonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the\nmuck,\nzilcon\nwood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was\npacked with miners, freight-crew-men—all the tide and wash of humanity\nthat made Swamp City the frontier post it is.\n \n  In front was a big sign. It read:\nONE NIGHT ONLY\n   \n  DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS\n   \n  NINE GENIUSES\n   \n  THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF\n   \n  THE SYSTEM\n \n  As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a\ntinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the\nfront row.\n \n  \"Sit here,\" she said. \"I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of\nthe players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go\nsomewhere and talk.\" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the\nstage steps and disappeared in the wings.\n \n  \"That damned fossilized dynamo,\" I muttered. \"She'll be the death of me\nyet.\"\n \n  The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the\nstage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian\nsat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The\nMercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably\nuncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new\nimproved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an\nEarthman operator.\nA tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and\nadvanced to the footlights.\n \n  \"People of Swamp City,\" he said, bowing, \"permit me to introduce\nmyself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.\"\n \n  There was a roar of applause from the\nSatellite\naudience. When it had\nsubsided, the man continued:\n \n  \"As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary\nto give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are\nnine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting\nsets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.\nThese questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every\nquestion missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand\nplanetoles\n.\n \n  \"One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match\nher wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of\nscience fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.\"\n \n  From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place\non the dais.\n \n  The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his\ndials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to\ncoalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his\nvoice echoed through the theater:\n \n  \"\nWho was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?\n\"\n \n  Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her\nhand. She said quietly:\n \n  \"Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed\ntracto-car.\"\n \n  And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in\nthe visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian\ncafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering\nbantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,\nor when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of\nthe winner.\n \n  It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had\nbrought me here. And then I began to notice things.\n \n  The audience in the\nSatellite\nseemed to have lost much of its\noriginal fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the\nsignal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.\n \n  Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a\ngeneral surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips\nwere turned in a smile of satisfaction.\n \n  When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving\ncrowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident\noccurred.\n \n  A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,\ndragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an\nunpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of\nthe Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to\nan earlier era.\n \n  Someone shouted, \"Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!\" As one\nman the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor\nwas seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,\nsnipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned\ninto his mouth.\n \n  Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men\nrushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to\nshout derisive epithets.\n \n  Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm\nand led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read\nTHE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place\nwas all but deserted.\n \n  In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober\neyes.\n \n  \"Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?\"\n \n  I nodded. \"As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. men\nought to clamp down.\"\n \n  \"The I.P. men aren't strong enough.\"\n \n  She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh\nline about her usually smiling lips.\n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\nFor a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n \n  \"My last book,\nDeath In The Atom\n, hit the stands last January,\"\nshe began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra\nKarn....\"\n \n  \"Who?\" I interrupted.\n \n  \"An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of\nVarsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.\"\n \n  The old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she\nasked abruptly.\n \n  I shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\"\n \n  \"It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active\nrock once found on Mercury. The\nAlpha\nrays of this rock are similar\nto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles\nprojected at high speed. But the character of the\nGamma\nrays has\nnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are\nelectromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of\nBeta\nor cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.\n \n  \"When any form of life is exposed to these\nGamma\nrays from the Green\nFlame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude\nand lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition\ndevelops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or\nguidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n \n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The\ncruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long\nenough to endanger all civilized life.\n \n  \"The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing\ngovernment was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had\nordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was\nimmediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom\nfollowed.\"\n \n  Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.\n \n  \"To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an\nold prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his\ntravels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of\nan old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green\nFlames!\"\n \n  If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.\nI said, \"So what?\"\n \n  \"So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean\nif it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets\nafter the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in\nexistence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.\n \n  \"Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made\ncorking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after\nit was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on\nEarth.\"\n \n  \"I see,\" I said as she lapsed into silence. \"And now you've come to the\nconclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is\nattempting to put your plot into action.\"\n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I think.\"\n \n  I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl\nand laughed heartily. \"The same old Flowers,\" I said. \"Tell me, who's\nyour thief ... Doctor Universe?\"\n \n  She regarded me evenly. \"What makes you say that?\"\n \n  I shrugged.\n \n  \"The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.\"\n \n  The old woman shook her head. \"No, this is a lot bigger than a simple\nquiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is\nhappening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,\npolice officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by\nrepresentation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military\ndictator to step in.\n \n  \"And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a\nsingle shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in\nmy opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand\ntimes more potent and is transmiting it\nen masse\n.\"\n \n  If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would\nhave called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of\napproaching danger.\n \n  \"Let's get out of here,\" I said, getting up.\nZinnng-whack!\n\"All right!\"\n \n  On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks\nappeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the\nfresco seemed to melt away suddenly.\n \n  A heat ray!\n \n  Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the\ndoor. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old\nwoman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and\nthrew over the starting stud.\n \n  An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.\nSix days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last\noutpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as\nthe eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick\nwater. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray\nsky like puffs of cotton.\n \n  We had traveled this far by\nganet\n, the tough little two headed pack\nanimal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have\nhad its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force\nbelt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to\nboatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy\njagua\ncanoes.\n \n  It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her\nconfidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.\n \n  \"We're heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find\nEzra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to\nthe lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You\nsee, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the\nship.\"\n \n  Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours\ntossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned\nsteadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi\njust before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer\nthat broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an\nisolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had\ngiven me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly\ncoming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that\nrepresentative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held\nto find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.\n \n  Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my\ntent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe\nGrannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots\nwhich she had skilfully blended into a novel?\n \n  Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its\nplace a ringing silence blanketed everything.\n \n  And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in\nundulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched\nit advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.\nIt charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.\nThere was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp\ntalons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,\nmissing the thing by the narrowest of margins.\n \n  From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress\nappeared. Grannie gave a single warning:\n \n  \"Stand still!\"\n \n  The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us\nagain. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of\npurple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the\nair. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the\nground and shot aloft.\nGrannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.\nI stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.\n \n  \"In heaven's name, what was it?\"\n \n  \"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here\nin the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be\ntrained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain\nand follows with a relentless purpose.\"\n \n  \"Then that would mean...?\"\n \n  \"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the\ncafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her\ntent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is\nbeing watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.\"\nThe following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\nresembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\nribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\nsurface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\nthe swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\nmulti-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\nThe Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\nhand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\na matter of seconds.\n \n  At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\nof the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\njetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\n \n  He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\nunkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\ndressed in\nvarpa\ncloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\nhead was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\nFlowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\nhut.\n \n  The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\ntype of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\ncivilization entirely.\n \n  Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\nobject of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\n \n  \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\nfind that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\n \n  \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\ncigarette. \"You know where it is, don't you?\"\n \n  \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\nVarsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\n \n  \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\n \n  Karn shook his head. \"They're a form of life that's never been seen by\nEarthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.\"\n \n  \"Dangerous?\"\n \n  \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\nof myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\nbecause I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped\nbecause he made 'em laugh.\"\n \n  \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.\n \n  \"That's right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\nthat's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\nlaugh, I don't know.\"\n \n  Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\nSeveral mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the\nVenusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\n \n  \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain't missed one in months.\nYou gotta wait 'til I hear it.\"\n \n  Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\nflipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\nchair, listening with avid interest.\n \n  It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\nheard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\nagain I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\nand forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi\nscreen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead\nmy thoughts far away.\nHalf an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen\nwere ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We\ncamped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed\nabout us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and\ndespondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the\nfutility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me\nfrom turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning,\nthat all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations.\n \n  After that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of\nsteaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our\nadvance on foot.\n \n  It was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he\nsuddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him.\nThere it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened\narelium\nsteel,\nhalf buried in the swamp soil.\n \n  \"What's that thing on top?\" Karn demanded, puzzled.\n \n  A rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern\nquarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And\nsuspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white\ninsulators.\n \n  Grannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. \"Billy-boy, take three\nVenusians and head across the knoll,\" she ordered. \"Ezra and I will\ncircle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.\"\n \n  But we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence.\nMoments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship.\n \n  A metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel.\nMid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door.\n \n  \"Up we go, Billy-boy.\" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to\nclimb slowly.\n \n  The silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open.\nThere was no sign of life.\n \n  \"Somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here,\" Ezra Karn observed.\n \n  Somebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the\nleft side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was\nbare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking\nclarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we\nlooked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles\nswing slowly to and fro.\n \n  Grannie nodded. \"Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in\nthe lower hold are probably exposed to a\ntholpane\nplate and their\nradiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.\"\n \n  Karn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the\nglass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact.\n \n  \"You'll never do it that way,\" Grannie said. \"Nothing short of an\natomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no\nguards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let's see if the\nGreen Flames are more accessible.\"\n \n  In the lower hold disappointment again confronted us. Visible in\nthe feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the\nvessel's hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore.\nSuspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal\nplate.\n \n  But between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass.\n \n  Grannie stamped her foot. \"It's maddening,\" she said. \"Here we are at\nthe crux of the whole matter, and we're powerless to make a single\nmove.\"\nOutside the day was beginning to wane. The Venusians, apparently\nunawed by the presence of the space ship, had already started a fire\nand erected the tents. We left the vessel to find a spell of brooding\ndesolation heavy over the improvised camp. And the evening meal this\ntime was a gloomy affair. When it was finished, Ezra Karn lit his pipe\nand switched on the portable visi set. A moment later the silence of\nthe march was broken by the opening fanfare of the Doctor Universe\nprogram.\n \n  \"Great stuff,\" Karn commented. \"I sent in a couple of questions once,\nbut I never did win nothin'. This Doctor Universe is a great guy. Ought\nto make him king or somethin'.\"\n \n  For a moment none of us made reply. Then suddenly Grannie Annie leaped\nto her feet.\n \n  \"Say that again!\" she cried.\n \n  The old prospector looked startled. \"Why, I only said they ought to\nmake this Doctor Universe the big boss and....\"\n \n  \"That's it!\" Grannie paced ten yards off into the gathering darkness\nand returned quickly. \"Billy-boy, you were right. The man behind this\nis\nDoctor Universe. It was he who stole my manuscript and devised a\nmethod to amplify the radiations of the Green Flames in the freighter's\nhold. He lit on a sure-fire plan to broadcast those radiations in such\na way that millions of persons would be exposed to them simultaneously.\nDon't you see?\"\n \n  I didn't see, but Grannie hurried on.\n \n  \"What better way to expose civilized life to the Green Flames\nradiations than when the people are in a state of relaxation. The\nDoctor Universe quiz program. The whole System tuned in on them, but\nthey were only a blind to cover up the transmission of the radiations\nfrom the ore. Their power must have been amplified a thousandfold, and\ntheir wave-length must lie somewhere between light and the supersonic\nscale in that transition band which so far has defied exploration....\"\n \n  \"But with what motive?\" I demanded. \"Why should...?\"\n \n  \"Power!\" the old woman answered. \"The old thirst for dictatorial\ncontrol of the masses. By presenting himself as an intellectual genius,\nDoctor Universe utilized a bizarre method to intrench himself in the\nminds of the people. Oh, don't you see, Billy-boy? The Green Flames'\nradiations spell doom to freedom, individual liberty.\"\n \n  I sat there stupidly, wondering if this all were some wild dream.\n \n  And then, as I looked across at Grannie Annie, the vague light over the\ntents seemed to shift a little, as if one layer of the atmosphere had\ndropped away to be replaced by another.\n \n  There it was again, a definite movement in the air. Somehow I got the\nimpression I was looking around that space rather than through it. And\nsimultaneously Ezra Karn uttered a howl of pain. An instant later the\nold prospector was rolling over and over, threshing his arms wildly.\n \n  An invisible sledge hammer descended on my shoulder. The blow was\nfollowed by another and another. Heavy unseen hands held me down.\nOpposite me Grannie Annie and the Venusians were suffering similar\npunishment, the latter screaming in pain and bewilderment.\n \n  \"It's the Varsoom!\" Ezra Karn yelled. \"We've got to make 'em laugh. Our\nonly escape is to make 'em laugh!\"\n \n  He struggled to his feet and began leaping wildly around the camp fire.\nAbruptly his foot caught on a log protruding from the fire; he tripped\nand fell headlong into a mass of hot coals and ashes. Like a jumping\njack he was on his feet again, clawing dirt and soot from his eyes.\n \n  Out of the empty space about us there came a sudden hush. The unseen\nblows ceased in mid-career. And then the silence was rent by wild\nlaughter. Peal after peal of mirthful yells pounded against our ears.\nFor many moments it continued; then it died away, and everything was\npeaceful once more.\n \n  Grannie Annie picked herself up slowly. \"That was close,\" she said. \"I\nwouldn't want to go through that again.\"\n \n  Ezra Karn nursed an ugly welt under one eye. \"Those Varsoom got a funny\nsense of humor,\" he growled.\nInside the freighter's narrow corridor Grannie faced me with eyes\nfilled with excitement.\n \n  \"Billy-boy,\" she said, \"we've got two problems now. We've got to stop\nDoctor Universe, and we've got to find a way of getting out of here.\nRight now we're nicely bottled up.\"\n \n  As if in answer to her words the visi set revealed the face of the quiz\nmaster on the screen. He was saying:\n \n  \"\nRemember tomorrow at this same hour I will have a message of\nunparalleled importance for the people of the nine planets. Tomorrow\nnight I urge you, I command you, to tune in.\n\"\n \n  With a whistling intake of breath the old woman turned to one of the\nVenusians.\n \n  \"Bring all our equipment in here,\" she ordered. \"Hurry!\"\n \n  She untied the ribbon under her chin and took off her cap. She rolled\nup her sleeves, and as the Venusians came marching into the space ship\nwith bundles of equipment, she fell to work.\n \n  Silently Ezra Karn and I watched her. First she completely dismantled\nthe visi set, put it together again with an entirely altered hookup.\nNext she unrolled a coil of flexible copper mesh which we had brought\nalong as a protective electrical screening against the marsh insects.\nShe fastened rubberite suction cups to this mesh at intervals of every\ntwelve inches or more, carried it down to the freighter's hold and\nfastened it securely against the stepto glass wall.\n \n  Trailing a three-ply conduit up from the hold to the corridor she\nselected an induction coil, several Micro-Wellman tubes and a quantity\nof wire from a box of spare parts. Dexterously her fingers moved in and\nout, fashioning a complicated and curious piece of apparatus.\n \n  At length she finished.\n \n  \"It's pretty hay-wire,\" she said, \"but I think it will work. Now I'll\ntell you what I'm going to do. When Doctor Universe broadcasts tomorrow\nnight, he's going to announce that he has set himself up as supreme\ndictator. He'll have the Green Flame radiations coming from this ship\nunder full power. I'm going to insert into his broadcast—the laughing\nof the Varsoom!\"\n \n  \"You're going to what?\"\n \n  \"Broadcast the mass laughter from those invisible creatures out there.\nVisualize it, Billy-boy! At the dramatic moment when Doctor Universe\nmakes his plea for System-wide power, he will be accompanied by wild\npeals of laughter. The whole broadcast will be turned into a burlesque.\"\n \n  \"How you going to make 'em laugh?\" interrupted Karn.\n \n  \"We must think of a way,\" Grannie replied soberly.\n \n  I, for one, am glad that no representative of the Interstellar\nPsychiatry Society witnessed our antics during the early hours of that\nmorning and on into the long reaches of the afternoon, as we vainly\ntried to provoke the laughter of the Varsoom. All to no avail. Utter\nsilence greeted our efforts. And the time was growing close to the\nscheduled Doctor Universe program.\n \n  Ezra Karn wiped a bead of perspiration from his brow. \"Maybe we've got\nto attract their attention first,\" he suggested. \"Miss Flowers, why\ndon't you go up on the roof and read to 'em? Read 'em something from\none of your books, if you've got one along. That ought to make 'em sit\nup and take notice.\"\n \n  For a moment the old woman gazed at him in silence. Then she got to her\nfeet quickly.\n \n  \"I'll do it,\" she said. \"I'll read them the attack scene from\nMurder\nOn A Space Liner\n.\"\nIt didn't make sense, of course. But nothing made sense in this mad\nventure. Grannie Annie opened her duffel bag and drew out a copy of\nher most popular book. With the volume under her arm, she mounted the\nladder to the top of the envelope. Ezra Karn rigged up a radite search\nlamp, and a moment later the old woman stood in the center of a circle\nof white radiance.\n \n  Karn gripped my arm. \"This is it,\" he said tensely. \"If this fails ...\"\n \n  His voice clipped off as Grannie began to read. She read slowly\nat first, then intoned the words and sentences faster and more\ndramatically.\n \n  And out in the swamp a vast hush fell as if unseen ears were listening.\n \n  \"...\nthe space liner was over on her beam ends now as another shot\nfrom the raider's vessel crashed into the stern hold. In the control\ncabin Cuthbert Strong twisted vainly at his bonds as he sought to free\nhimself. Opposite him, lashed by strong Martian vinta ropes to the\ngravascope, Louise Belmont sobbed softly, wringing her hands in mute\nappeal.\n\"\n \n  A restless rustling sounded out in the marsh, as if hundreds of bodies\nwere surging closer. Karn nodded in awe.\n \n  \"She's got 'em!\" he whispered. \"Listen. They're eatin' up every word.\"\n \n  I heard it then, and I thought I must be dreaming. From somewhere out\nin the swamp a sound rose into the thick air. A high-pitched chuckle,\nit was. The chuckle came again. Now it was followed by another and\nanother. An instant later a wave of low subdued laughter rose into the\nair.\n \n  Ezra Karn gulped. \"Gripes!\" he said. \"They're laughing already.\nThey're laughing at her book!\nAnd look, the old lady's gettin' sore.\"\n \n  Up on the roof of the envelope Grannie Annie halted her reading to\nglare savagely out into the darkness.\n \n  The laughter was a roar now. It rose louder and louder, peal after peal\nof mirthful yells and hysterical shouts. And for the first time in my\nlife, I saw Annabella C. Flowers mad. She stamped her foot; she shook\nher fist at the unseen hordes out before her.\n \n  \"Ignorant slap-happy fools!\" she screamed. \"You don't know good science\nfiction when you hear it.\"\n \n  I turned to Karn and said quietly, \"Turn on the visi set. Doctor\nUniverse should be broadcasting now. Tune your microphone to pull in\nas much of that laughter as you can.\"\nIt took three weeks to make the return trip to Swamp City. The Varsoom\nfollowed us far beyond the frontier of their country like an unseen\narmy in the throes of laughing gas. Not until we reached Level Five did\nthe last chuckle fade into the distance.\n \n  All during that trek back, Grannie sat in the dugout, staring silently\nout before her.\n \n  But when we reached Swamp City, the news was flung at us from all\nsides. One newspaper headline accurately told the story: DOCTOR\nUNIVERSE BID FOR SYSTEM DICTATORSHIP SQUELCHED BY RIDICULE OF UNSEEN\nAUDIENCE. QUIZ MASTER NOW IN HANDS OF I.P. COUP FAILURE.\n \n  \"Grannie,\" I said that night as we sat again in a rear booth of THE\nJET, \"what are you going to do now? Give up writing science fiction?\"\n \n  She looked at me soberly, then broke into a smile.\n \n  \"Just because some silly form of life that can't even be seen doesn't\nappreciate it? I should say not. Right now I've got an idea for a swell\nyarn about Mars. Want to come along while I dig up some background\nmaterial?\"\n \n  I shook my head. \"Not me,\" I said.\n \n  But I knew I would.\n",

The two sit down to have a drink in an empty portion of the club, but they only have a minute to chat before Grannie Annie remembers she has an appointment at the Satellite Theater. She insists that Billy come with her. \n\nGrannie Annie forces Billy to take a seat in the audience, and she takes her place backstage. The show is called “Doctor Universe and His Nine Geniuses,” and it’s a type of gameshow. People and creatures on nine different planets tune into the program, and they ask the geniuses questions. If the show’s experts cannot answer the question, the listener gets a sum of money. Grannie Annie is there to serve as the guest star. \n\nThe show goes off without a hitch. The only remarkable thing that Billy notices is that the audience appears to be mesmerized by Dr. Universe. \n\nGrannie Annie tells Billy that while she was writing a sequel to her latest novel, she met Ezra Karn, and he told her about the Green Flames. The Green Flame is a radioactive rock originally found on Mercury, and the rock’s Gamma Rays have the power to make people and creatures have a strong desire for a leader. Grannie Annie included these fantastical ideas in her recent novel, but her manuscript was stolen. Now, she’s concerned that the rocks and rays will be used by an authoritarian leader. \n\nIn the middle of their conversation, Grannie Annie and Billy are attacked by someone with a heat ray. The pair leaves Swamp City, followed by the enemy. They travel and find Ezra Karn in his home. \n\nKarn takes his friends to the spaceship where the Green Flames are stored. The precious resource is behind impenetrable glass, and it’s clear that whoever controls it made sure it was safe. \n\nKarn is an avid Doctor Universe fan, and he off-handedly tells Grannie Annie and Billy that they ought to make the man the king. Grannie Annie realizes that Doctor Universe is in fact the person hoarding the Green Flames, and he’s using his quiz show to control the minds of the masses so that he can take over as dictator. \n\nWithout warning, Billy and his friends feel an invisible force pushing them and holding down their bodies. They recognize force as the Varsoom, and the only way to stop it is to make them laugh. Grannie Annie builds a machine that allows the group to interrupt Doctor Universe’s broadcast. \n\nWhen Doctor Universe comes on the radio again, Grannie Annie reads one of her science fiction books to the invisible creatures. The plan works, and the Varsoom laugh wildly, which ruins the Doctor’s plans to take over the universe. Grannie Annie says it won’t deter her from writing her novels, and she invites Billy to come along for the research portion of her next project. \n\n"

The narrator is surprised to hear from a member of the staff that there is a woman here to see him--his friend Grannie Annie, who is known by lovers of science fiction novels by her pen name, Annabella C. Flowers. As they catch up over drinks, she interrupts to lead them to a Doctor Universe quiz show at the Satellite Theater. In this game show, she acts as an expert in the history of the solar system alongside members of various interplanetary races. After the seemingly innocuous show, there is a racist attack on a Martian outside of the theater. Grannie Annie finds a location to fill Billy (the narrator) in on a theory. She tells him about Ezra Karn, a prospector she met while doing research for one of her books. He found a large supply of Green Flame, a radioactive Mercurian rock that has opiate-like effects on those who are exposed to it. It had been used under some dictatorships to control populations. Grannie Annie had written a novel about Green Flame, but she thought someone had stolen the manuscript and was going through with the plot, using the rocks to affect people’s mindsets. Billy suspects Doctor Universe is the one with the evil plan, but Grannie is less convinced. The two had to run after they were shot at and headed out to find Ezra and the Green Flame. Traveling on pack animals and then in canoes through the swampland with some Venetian guides, Billy was increasingly stressed by the state of the world. They found Ezra after being attacked by a hunter-bird that had been sent after them. His two-room hut was equipped with the latest visi set, allowing him to watch the Doctor Universe program. He agreed to take them to the ship where he had seen the Green Flame after the show. When they arrived, they found the ship outfitted with a self-operating broadcasting unit which was well-protected behind unbreakable glass. The group had already started to feel the effects of the radiation, feeling despondent, but they knew they had to do something. Grannie realizes that Billy was right, and Doctor Universe was the one with the evil plan. After the camp was attacked by the Varsoom, an energy being native to the area of Venus they were in, Grannie had an idea. The only way to escape the Varsoom attack was to make them laugh, so she rigged Ezra’s visi set to be able to insert the sound of them laughing into the broadcast of the game show. The group could not find a way to make them laugh, until Grannie read them her book. Their laughter made it into the broadcast, thwarting Doctor Universe’s plans for becoming dictator of the solar system. In the end, Grannie decides she wants to keep writing novels and invites Billy on a trip to Mars for background research for her next book."

He runs out to meet her in the lobby then takes her up to the grille where she won’t be seen. They share a drink, while he asks her what she’s doing in town. Grannie Annie, better known as Annabella C. Flowers, is a popular science fiction writer. Before she can explain her arrival, she rushes to the Satellite Theater, taking Billy with her. She’s a participant in the Doctor Universe game show, and she wants Billy to watch. \nAfter the show is over, a racist interaction takes place. The I.P. comes around to break it up, but not before one Kagor was seriously hurt. \nGrannie Annie takes Billy into another restaurant and finally explains herself. She was writing a sequel for her last book and was doing research on Venus. There she met Ezra Karn, an older man with plenty of stories to tell. He told her of the Green Flames, an ore that released gamma rays stronger than any drug known to man. They made people receptive and easily manipulated. \nShe wrote a book about it and included many facts that Karn told her, including the location of the remaining Green Flames. The manuscript was stolen, and now she believes that this person is using the Geren Flame to control people. \nBilly immediately thinks the suspect is Doctor Universe, but Grannie blows him off. She thinks that someone has figured out a way to broadcast the emissions. A heat ray blasts toward them, almost killing Grannie Annie. They rush to the hydrocar and get out of there. \nFinally, they reach Level Five close to Vansoom territory, where Karn lives. The Vansooms are energy creatures, extremely dangerous, and volatile. They take a boat, where a trained hunter-bird attacks them. They survive thanks to Grannie’s shooting skills. They meet Karn at last and he agrees to show them to the shipwreck after they listen to the latest Doctor Universe gameshow. \nThey reach the ship and see that someone has added to it. A network of wires ran across the shipwreck, protected by impenetrable glass. As was the Green Flames. Since they weren’t able to destroy it, the team sets up camp and hatches a new plan. \nAfter being attacked by the Vansooms, they realize that laughter is the only way to fend them off. Grannie Annie decides to broadcast the Vansooms’ laughter over the next Doctor Universe gameshow, where he is to announce his incoming dictatorship. They spend the next day attempting to make the Vansoom’s laugh but only succeed when Grannie Annie reads a chapter from her most popular novel. They broadcast their laughter over Doctor Universe and override his cry for power. \nThey make their way back home, a longer journey thanks to the Vansoom, and are greeted by the news that Doctor Universe failed. Grannie invites Billy to Mars where she will research her next novel.\n"

The rock was originally found on Mercury, and its composition is only partially understood, but it is clear that all types of life forms are affected by the drug-like effects of its radiation. Initially, it appears to just drain some energy, but with increased exposure, the beings search for more direction and guidance, a desire that can be fulfilled by political power of dictators. In fact, it had been used specifically for this purpose on Earth, Venus, and Mars by a dictator named Vennox I. He required that two pieces of Green Flame were in every household, which ensure that the people wanted to look to him for guidance. The stash of this rock that was found in an abandoned ship on the surface of Venus is the last remaining supply, as it was mostly destroyed after the dictatorship ended. When Grannie Annie found out about the supply, through a prospector named Ezra Karn, she decided to use it as part of the plot for her newest novel. However, Doctor Universe used the details of the story to devise his own plot to use the Green Flame to try to start his own dictatorship. He used broadcast technology to extend the effects of the radioactive rock, so that it affected anyone who watched his quiz show.

It is immediately clear that Grannie Annie runs the show in their relationship, in part because Billy is willing to risk his reputation at the men’s club in order to make his elderly friends happy. Within minutes, Billy is whisked away to the theater to watch Annie guest star on Doctor Universe’s show, even though she does not explain the plan to him and he has little interest in being an audience member.\n\nAlthough the rest of the world knows Grannie Annie as Annabella C. Flowers, the name she uses to publish her science fiction novels, Billy would never address her so formally. There is an obvious feeling of trust between the two characters. When Grannie Annie gets her novel stolen and worries that there’s a dictator about to take over the universe, she finds Billy to help her solve the case. Similarly, when Grannie Annie spills her guts about her far-fetched theory about her novel inspiring an evil villain to use the Green Flames to control millions of beings, Billy believes her right off the bat. \n\nThe pair get along very well, and it’s clear that’s the case when Grannie Annie asks Billy to accompany her on her next trip to research her upcoming novel. Billy simply can’t say no to his friend, whom he deeply admires. \n"

At the beginning of the story, we see that Grannie Annie has approached Billy to talk about her concerns for the political climate based on the manuscript of one of her novels. Billy admits to the reader that her story of what was happening, told by anyone else, would be hard to believe, but from her he knows there has to be some truth to it. He also trusts her enough to go along on her expedition to find Ezra, the abandoned ship, and the Green Flame. They know each other well enough ability to know that Grannie’s usual drink is a whiskey sour. At the end of the story, although Billy says he does not want to join on a trip to Mars, he admits to the reader that he knows he will join on another adventure, following Grannie wherever she goes."

Then, he thinks to himself, Of course, I’ll go. \nGrannie Annie shows up at the exclusive, men-only club Billy was playing at and knew he would come with her.

Ezra Karn is a prospector who lives in a deep marsh in Varsoom country. Grannie Annie learns that the Green Flames were not all destroyed after the last dictatorship when he tells her that he stumbled upon the resource in an abandoned spaceship. \n\nGrannie Annie and Billy find Karn at his hut in the marsh. They ask Karn to take them to the Green Flames, and after some hesitation, he agrees. He knows that the only way to defeat the Varsoom is to make them laugh, but he does not know what exactly they think is funny. He is a huge fan of Doctor Universe, and he never misses a show. \n\nEzra Karn successfully takes Grannie Annie and Billy to the spaceship he previously found. Within moments of laying eyes on it, Karl yells out in pain. He rolls around on the ground, trying to stand but failing. He informs his companions that the force he is dealing with is the Varsoom, and the only way to end the madness is to make them laugh. \n\nWhen it’s time to interrupt Doctor Universe’s broadcast to stop him from taking over the universe, it is Karn’s idea to have Grannie Annie read her book to the Varsoom. He does not realize that they will find it funny, but he does think it’s a good way to get the invisible creatures’ attention. He essentially saves everyone, since Grannie Annie’s book makes the Varsoom laugh and laugh and make it impossible for Doctor Universe to control the minds of the masses. \n"

Ezra is a prospector, and he finds his home in the swamps where the Varsoom live. When Grannie Annie and Billy make it to the swamplands and marshes, they find Ezra, and Grannie Annie asks him to guide the group to the spaceship that held the Green Flames he had told her about. He agrees, though he warns the group about the Varsoom, an energy life form that could potentially be dangerous. He refuses to miss a showing of Doctor Universe’s quiz show, but guides the group after the show is over. Ezra was the first person to see the ship they were looking for, and asked about the broadcasting apparatus that was built on top of it. He circled the ship with Grannie as the group split up to survey the area, and once they entered the ship, Ezra tried using his pistol to break the glass that was protecting the equipment. Eventually, after camp was set up, he watched Doctor Universe again as he smoked his pipe. When Ezra suggests that Doctor Universe is a wonderful person to be made a leader, Grannie realizes that Billy was right about Doctor Universe wanting to take over. Ezra, along with the rest of the group, experienced extreme pain as the Varsoom showed up. Ezra reminded the group that they needed to make these beings laugh, and as he did a silly dance, he tripped and fell, which did the trick. Ezra and Billy watch Grannie set up the altered visi set to disrupt the broadcast following day. He set up a lamp for Grannie when she started to read her book to the Varsoom, and once they have the laughter they needed, he turned on the equipment so that the microphone could add the laughter of the Varsoom to the Doctor Universe broadcast."
