GOLD\nHarvey and Joe were the slickest con-men ever\n   \n  to gyp a space-lane sucker. Or so they thought!\n   \n  Angus Johnson knew differently. He charged them\n   \n  five buckos for a glass of water—and got it!\n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories May 1943.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\nCharacteristically, Harvey Ellsworth tried to maintain his dignity,\nthough his parched tongue was almost hanging out. But Joe Mallon, with\nno dignity to maintain, lurched across the rubbish-strewn patch of land\nthat had been termed a spaceport. When Harvey staggered pontifically\ninto the battered metalloy saloon—the only one on Planetoid 42—his\ntall, gangling partner was already stumbling out, mouthing something\nincoherent. They met in the doorway, violently.\n \n  \"We're delirious!\" Joe cried. \"It's a mirage!\"\n \n  \"What is?\" asked Harvey through a mouthful of cotton.\n \n  Joe reeled aside, and Harvey saw what had upset his partner. He stared,\nspeechless for once.\n \n  In their hectic voyages from planet to planet, the pair of panacea\npurveyors had encountered the usual strange life-forms. But never had\nthey seen anything like the amazing creature in that colonial saloon.\n \n  Paying no attention to them, it was carrying a case of liquor in two\nhands, six siphons in two others, and a broom and dustpan in the\nremaining pair. The bartender, a big man resembling the plumpish\nHarvey in build, was leaning negligently on the counter, ordering this\nimpossible being to fill the partly-emptied bottles, squeeze fruit\njuice and sweep the floor, all of which the native did simultaneously.\n \n  \"Nonsense,\" Harvey croaked uncertainly. \"We have seen enough queer\nthings to know there are always more.\"\n \n  He led the way inside. Through thirst-cracked lips he rasped:\n\"Water—quick!\"\n \n  Without a word, the bartender reached under the counter, brought out\ntwo glasses of water. The interplanetary con-men drank noisily, asked\nfor more, until they had drunk eight glasses. Meanwhile, the bartender\nhad taken out eight jiggers and filled them with whiskey.\n \n  Harvey and Joe were breathing hard from having gulped the water so\nfast, but they were beginning to revive. They noticed the bartender's\nimpersonal eyes studying them shrewdly.\n \n  \"Strangers, eh?\" he asked at last.\n \n  \"Solar salesmen, my colonial friend,\" Harvey answered in his usual\nlush manner. \"We purvey that renowned Martian remedy,\nLa-anago\nYergis\n, the formula for which was recently discovered by ourselves in\nthe ancient ruined city of La-anago. Medical science is unanimous in\nproclaiming this magic medicine the sole panacea in the entire history\nof therapeutics.\"\n \n  \"Yeah?\" said the bartender disinterestedly, polishing the chaser\nglasses without washing them. \"Where you heading?\"\n \n  \"Out of Mars for Ganymede. Our condenser broke down, and we've gone\nwithout water for five ghastly days.\"\n \n  \"Got a mechanic around this dumping ground you call a port?\" Joe asked.\n \n  \"We did. He came near starving and moved on to Titan. Ships don't land\nhere unless they're in trouble.\"\n \n  \"Then where's the water lead-in? We'll fill up and push off.\"\n \n  \"Mayor takes care of that,\" replied the saloon owner. \"If you gents're\nfinished at the bar, your drinks'll be forty buckos.\"\n \n  Harvey grinned puzzledly. \"We didn't take any whiskey.\"\n \n  \"Might as well. Water's five buckos a glass. Liquor's free with every\nchaser.\"\n \n  Harvey's eyes bulged. Joe gulped. \"That—that's robbery!\" the lanky man\nmanaged to get out in a thin quaver.\n \n  The barkeeper shrugged. \"When there ain't many customers, you gotta\nmake more on each one. Besides—\"\n \n  \"Besides nothing!\" Joe roared, finding his voice again. \"You dirty\ncrook—robbing poor spacemen! You—\"\n\"You dirty crook!\" Joe roared. \"Robbing honest spacemen!\"\nHarvey nudged him warningly. \"Easy, my boy, easy.\" He turned to the\nbartender apologetically. \"Don't mind my friend. His adrenal glands are\nsometimes overactive. You were going to say—?\"\nThe round face of the barkeeper had assumed an aggrieved expression.\n \n  \"Folks are always thinkin' the other feller's out to do 'em,\" he said,\nshaking his head. \"Lemme explain about the water here. It's bitter\nas some kinds of sin before it's purified. Have to bring it in with\nbuckets and make it sweet. That takes time and labor. Waddya think—I\nwas chargin' feller critters for water just out of devilment? I charge\nbecause I gotta.\"\n \n  \"Friend,\" said Harvey, taking out a wallet and counting off eight\nfive-bucko bills, \"here is your money. What's fair is fair, and you\nhave put a different complexion on what seemed at first to be an\nunconscionable interjection of a middleman between Nature and man's\nthirst.\"\n \n  The saloon man removed his dirty apron and came around the bar.\n \n  \"If that's an apology, I accept it. Now the mayor'll discuss filling\nyour tanks. That's me. I'm also justice of the peace, official\nrecorder, fire chief....\"\n \n  \"And chief of police, no doubt,\" said Harvey jocosely.\n \n  \"Nope. That's my son, Jed. Angus Johnson's my name. Folks here just\ncall me Chief. I run this town, and run it right. How much water will\nyou need?\"\n \n  Joe estimated quickly. \"About seventy-five liters, if we go on half\nrations,\" he answered. He waited apprehensively.\n \n  \"Let's say ten buckos a liter,\" the mayor said. \"On account of the\nquantity, I'm able to quote a bargain price. Shucks, boys, it hurts me\nmore to charge for water than it does for you to pay. I just got to,\nthat's all.\"\n \n  The mayor gestured to the native, who shuffled out to the tanks with\nthem. The planetoid man worked the pump while the mayor intently\nwatched the crude level-gauge, crying \"Stop!\" when it registered the\nproper amount. Then Johnson rubbed his thumb on his index finger and\nwetted his lips expectantly.\n \n  Harvey bravely counted off the bills. He asked: \"But what are we to\ndo about replenishing our battery fluid? Ten buckos a liter would be\npreposterous. We simply can't afford it.\"\n \n  Johnson's response almost floored them. \"Who said anything about\ncharging you for battery water? You can have all you want for nothing.\nIt's just the purified stuff that comes so high.\"\n \n  After giving them directions that would take them to the free-water\npool, the ponderous factotum of Planetoid 42 shook hands and headed\nback to the saloon. His six-armed assistant followed him inside.\n \n  \"Now do you see, my hot-tempered colleague?\" said Harvey as he and Joe\npicked up buckets that hung on the tank. \"Johnson, as I saw instantly,\nis the victim of a difficult environment, and must charge accordingly.\"\n \n  \"Just the same,\" Joe griped, \"paying for water isn't something you can\nget used to in ten minutes.\"\n \n  In the fragile forest, they soon came across a stream that sprang from\nthe igneous soil and splashed into the small pond whose contents,\naccording to the mayor, was theirs for the asking. They filled their\nbuckets and hauled them to the ship, then returned for more.\nIt was on the sixth trip that Joe caught a glimpse of Jupiter-shine on\na bright surface off to the left. The figure, 750, with the bucko sign\nin front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keeping\na faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went to\ninvestigate.\n \n  Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound\nthat was unmistakably a buried pipe.\n \n  \"What's this doing here?\" Harvey asked, puzzled. \"I thought Johnson had\nto transport water in pails.\"\n \n  \"Wonder where it leads to,\" Joe said uneasily.\n \n  \"It leads\nto\nthe saloon,\" said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing the\npipe back toward the spaceport. \"What I am concerned with is where it\nleads\nfrom\n.\"\n \n  Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion of\nscrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burst\ninto the open—before a clear, sparkling pool.\n \n  Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.\n \n  \"I am growing suspicious,\" he said in a rigidly controlled voice.\n \n  But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water and\ntasting it.\n \n  \"Sweet!\" he snarled.\n \n  They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample.\nHis mouth went wry. \"Bitter! He uses only one pool, the sweet one! The\nonly thing that needs purifying around here is that blasted mayor's\nconscience.\"\n \n  \"The asteroidal Poobah has tricked us with a slick come-on,\" said\nHarvey slowly. His eyes grew cold. \"Joseph, the good-natured artist in\nme has become a hard and merciless avenger. I shall not rest until we\nhave had the best of this colonial con-man! Watch your cues from this\npoint hence.\"\n \n  Fists clenched, the two returned to the saloon. But at the door they\nstopped and their fists unclenched.\n \n  \"Thought you gents were leaving,\" the mayor called out, seeing them\nfrozen in the doorway. \"Glad you didn't. Now you can meet my son, Jed.\nHim and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.\"\n \n  \"You don't need any more,\" said Harvey, dismayed.\n \n  Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hair\nand held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously been\nborn and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would have\nkept him down near the general dimensions of a man.\n \n  He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his own\nhand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again when\nhis fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressed\none.\n \n  \"Pleased to meet you,\" piped a voice that had never known a dense\natmosphere.\n \n  The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick and\nunpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....\n \n  \"Joseph!\" he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. \"Don't you\nfeel well?\"\n \n  Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes were\ngently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his features\ndrooping like a bloodhound's.\n \n  \"Bring him in here!\" Johnson cried. \"I mean, get him away! He's coming\ndown with asteroid fever!\"\n \n  \"Of course,\" replied Harvey calmly. \"Any fool knows the first symptoms\nof the disease that once scourged the universe.\"\n \n  \"What do you mean,\nonce\n?\" demanded Johnson. \"I come down with it\nevery year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him\nout of here!\"\n \n  \"In good time. He can't be moved immediately.\"\n \n  \"Then he'll be here for months!\"\n \n  Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and\nhis gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe\nin tiny, uncontaminating gasps.\n \n  \"You'll find everything you want in the back room,\" Johnson said\nfrantically, \"sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suction\ncups—\"\n \n  \"Relics of the past,\" Harvey stated. \"One medication is all modern man\nrequires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.\"\n \n  \"What's that?\" asked the mayor without conviction.\n \n  Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-hand\nrocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within a\nfew minutes, carrying a bottle.\nJoe was still stretched out on the bar, panting, his eyes slowly\ncrossing and uncrossing. Harvey lifted the patient's head tenderly,\nput the bottle to his lips and tilted it until he was forced to drink.\nWhen Joe tried to pull away, Harvey was inexorable. He made his partner\ndrink until most of the liquid was gone. Then he stepped back and\nwaited for the inevitable result.\n \n  Joe's performance was better than ever. He lay supine for several\nmoments, his face twisted into an expression that seemed doomed\nto perpetual wryness. Slowly, however, he sat up and his features\nstraightened out.\n \n  \"Are—are you all right?\" asked the mayor anxiously.\n \n  \"Much better,\" said Joe in a weak voice.\n \n  \"Maybe you need another dose,\" Harvey suggested.\n \n  Joe recoiled. \"I'm fine now!\" he cried, and sprang off the bar to prove\nit.\n \n  Astonished, Johnson and his son drew closer. They searched Joe's face,\nand then the mayor timidly felt his pulse.\n \n  \"Well, I'll be hanged!\" Johnson ejaculated.\n \n  \"\nLa-anago Yergis\nnever fails, my friend,\" Harvey explained. \"By\nactual test, it conquers asteroid fever in from four to twenty-three\nminutes, depending on the severity of the attack. Luckily, we caught\nthis one before it grew formidable.\"\n \n  The mayor's eyes became clouded mirrors of an inward conflict. \"If you\ndon't charge too much,\" he said warily, \"I might think of buying some.\"\n \n  \"We do not sell this unbelievable remedy,\" Harvey replied with dignity.\n\"It sells itself.\"\n \n  \"'Course, I'd expect a considerable reduction if I bought a whole\ncase,\" said Johnson.\n \n  \"That would be the smallest investment you could make, compared with\nthe vast loss of time and strength the fever involves.\"\n \n  \"How much?\" asked the mayor unhappily.\n \n  \"For you, since you have taken us in so hospitably, a mere five hundred\nbuckos.\"\n \n  Johnson did not actually stagger back, but he gave the impression of\ndoing so. \"F-four hundred,\" he offered.\n \n  \"Not a red cent less than four seventy-five,\" Harvey said flatly.\n \n  \"Make it four fifty,\" quavered Johnson.\n \n  \"I dislike haggling,\" said Harvey.\n \n  The final price, however, was four hundred and sixty-nine buckos and\nfifty redsents. Magnanimously, Harvey added: \"And we will include,\ngratis\n, an elegant bottle-opener, a superb product of Mercurian\nhandicraftsmanship.\"\n \n  Johnson stabbed out a warning finger. \"No tricks now. I want a taste of\nthat stuff. You're not switching some worthless junk on me.\"\n \n  Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample. The\nmayor sniffed it, grimaced, then threw it down his gullet. The ensuing\nminute saw a grim battle between a man and his stomach, a battle which\nthe man gradually won.\n \n  \"There ain't no words for that taste,\" he gulped when it was safe to\ntalk again.\n \n  \"Medicine,\" Harvey propounded, \"should taste like medicine.\" To Joe he\nsaid: \"Come, my esteemed colleague. We must perform the sacred task to\nwhich we have dedicated ourselves.\"\n \n  With Joe stumbling along behind, he left the saloon, crossed the\nclearing and entered the ship. As soon as they were inside, Joe dropped\nhis murderous silence and cried:\n \n  \"What kind of a dirty trick was that, giving me poison instead of that\nsnake oil?\"\n \n  \"That was not poison,\" Harvey contradicted quietly. \"It was\nLa-anago\nYergis\nextract, plus.\"\n \n  \"Plus what—arsenic?\"\n \n  \"Now, Joseph! Consider my quandary when I came back here to manufacture\nour specific for all known ailments, with the intention of selling\nyonder asteroidal tin-horn a bill of medical goods—an entire case,\nmind you. Was I to mix the extract with the water for which we had been\nswindled to the tune of ten buckos a liter? Where would our profit have\nbeen, then? No; I had to use the bitter free water, of course.\"\n \n  \"But why use it on me?\" Joe demanded furiously.\n \n  Harvey looked reprovingly at his gangling partner. \"Did Johnson ask to\ntaste it, or did he not? One must look ahead, Joseph. I had to produce\nthe same\nmedicine\nthat we will now manufacture. Thus, you were a\nguinea pig for a splendid cause.\"\n \n  \"Okay, okay,\" Joe said. \"But you shoulda charged him more.\"\n \n  \"Joseph, I promise you that we shall get back every redsent of which\nthat swindler cheated us, besides whatever other funds or valuables he\npossesses. We could not be content with less.\"\n \n  \"Well, we're starting all right,\" admitted Joe. \"How about that thing\nwith six arms? He looks like a valuable. Can't we grab him off?\"\n \n  Harvey stopped filling bottles and looked up pensively.\n \n  \"I have every hope of luring away the profitable monstrosity.\nApparently you have also surmised the fortune we could make with him.\nAt first I purpose to exhibit him on our interplanetary tours with our\nstreamlined panacea; he would be a spectacular attraction for bucolic\nsuckers. Later, a brief period of demonstrating his abilities on the\naudio-visiphone. Then our triumph—we shall sell him at a stupendous\nfigure to the zoo!\"\nJoe was still dazed by that monetary vista when he and Harvey carried\nthe case of medicine to the saloon. The mayor had already cleared a\nplace of honor in the cluttered back room, where he told them to put it\ndown carefully. Then he took the elaborate bottle-opener Harvey gave\nhim, reverently uncorked a bottle and sampled it. It must have been at\nleast as good as the first; he gagged.\n \n  \"That's the stuff, all right,\" he said, swallowing hard. He counted\nout the money into Harvey's hand, at a moderate rate that precariously\nbalanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his pain\nat paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter,\nand asked: \"You gents eaten yet? The restaurant's open now.\"\n \n  Harvey and Joe looked at each other. They hadn't been thinking about\nfood at all, but suddenly they realized that they were hungry.\n \n  \"It's only water we were short of,\" Harvey said apprehensively. \"We've\ngot rations back at the ship.\"\n \n  \"\nH-mph!\n\" the mayor grunted. \"Powdered concentrates. Compressed pap.\nSuit yourselves. We treat our stomachs better here. And you're welcome\nto our hospitality.\"\n \n  \"Your hospitality,\" said Harvey, \"depends on the prices you charge.\"\n \n  \"Well, if that's what's worrying you, you can stop worrying,\" answered\nthe mayor promptly. \"What's more, the kind of dinner I serve here you\ncan't get anywhere else for any price.\"\n \n  Swiftly, Harvey conned the possibilities of being bilked again. He saw\nnone.\n \n  \"Let's take a look at the menu, anyhow, Joe,\" he said guardedly.\n \n  Johnson immediately fell into the role of \"mine host.\"\n \n  \"Come right in, gents,\" he invited. \"Right into the dining room.\"\n \n  He seated them at a table, which a rope tied between posts made more or\nless private, though nobody else was in the saloon and there was little\nchance of company.\n \n  Genius, the six-armed native, appeared from the dingy kitchen with\ntwo menus in one hand, two glasses of water in another, plus napkins,\nsilverware, a pitcher, plates, saucers, cups, and their cocktails,\nwhich were on the house. Then he stood by for orders.\n \n  Harvey and Joe studied the menu critically. The prices were\nphenomenally low. When they glanced up at Johnson in perplexity, he\ngrinned, bowed and asked: \"Everything satisfactory, gents?\"\n \n  \"Quite,\" said Harvey. \"We shall order.\"\n \n  For an hour they were served amazing dishes, both fresh and canned, the\nculinary wealth of this planetoid and all the system. And the service\nwas as extraordinary as the meal itself. With four hands, Genius played\ndeftly upon a pair of mellow Venusian\nviotars\n, using his other two\nhands for waiting on the table.\n \n  \"We absolutely must purchase this incredible specimen,\" Harvey\nwhispered excitedly when Johnson and the native were both in the\nkitchen, attending to the next course. \"He would make any society\nhostess's season a riotous success, which should be worth a great sum\nto women like Mrs. van Schuyler-Morgan, merely for his hire.\"\n \n  \"Think of a fast one fast,\" Joe agreed. \"You're right.\"\n \n  \"But I dislike having to revise my opinion of a man so often,\"\ncomplained Harvey. \"I wish Johnson would stay either swindler or honest\nmerchant. This dinner is worth as least twenty buckos, yet I estimate\nour check at a mere bucko twenty redsents.\"\n \n  The mayor's appearance prevented them from continuing the discussion.\n \n  \"It's been a great honor, gents,\" he said. \"Ain't often I have\nvisitors, and I like the best, like you two gents.\"\n \n  As if on cue, Genius came out and put the check down between Joe and\nHarvey. Harvey picked it up negligently, but his casual air vanished in\na yelp of horror.\n \n  \"What the devil is this?\" he shouted.—\"How do you arrive at this\nfantastic, idiotic figure—\nthree hundred and twenty-eight buckos\n!\"\nJohnson didn't answer. Neither did Genius; he simply put on the table,\nnot a fingerbowl, but a magnifying glass. With one of his thirty\nfingers he pointed politely to the bottom of the menu.\n \n  Harvey focused on the microscopic print, and his face went pasty with\nrage. The minute note read: \"Services and entertainment, 327 buckos 80\nredsents.\"\n \n  \"You can go to hell!\" Joe growled. \"We won't pay it!\"\n \n  Johnson sighed ponderously. \"I was afraid you'd act like that,\" he said\nwith regret. He pulled a tin badge out of his rear pocket, pinned it on\nhis vest, and twisted his holstered gun into view. \"Afraid I'll have to\nask the sheriff to take over.\"\n \n  Johnson, the \"sheriff,\" collected the money, and Johnson, the\n\"restaurateur,\" pocketed it. Meanwhile, Harvey tipped Joe the sign to\nremain calm.\n \n  \"My friend,\" he said to the mayor, and his tones took on a\nschoolmasterish severity, \"your long absence from Earth has perhaps\nmade you forget those elements of human wisdom that have entered the\nfolk-lore of your native planet. Such as, for example: 'It is folly\nto kill a goose that lays golden eggs,' and 'Penny wise is pound\nfoolish.'\"\n \n  \"I don't get the connection,\" objected Johnson.\n \n  \"Well, by obliging us to pay such a high price for your dinner, you put\nout of your reach the chance of profiting from a really substantial\ndeal. My partner and I were prepared to make you a sizable offer for\nthe peculiar creature you call Genius. But by reducing our funds the\nway you have—\"\n \n  \"Who said I wanted to sell him?\" the mayor interrupted. He rubbed his\nfingers together and asked disinterestedly: \"What were you going to\noffer, anyhow?\"\n \n  \"It doesn't matter any longer,\" Harvey said with elaborate\ncarelessness. \"Perhaps you wouldn't have accepted it, anyway.\"\n \n  \"That's right,\" Johnson came back emphatically. \"But what would your\noffer have been which I would have turned down?\"\n \n  \"Which one? The one we were going to make, or the one we can make now?\"\n \n  \"Either one. It don't make no difference. Genius is too valuable to\nsell.\"\n \n  \"Oh, come now, Mr. Johnson. Don't tell me no amount of money would\ntempt you!\"\n \n  \"Nope. But how much did you say?\"\n \n  \"Ah, then you will consider releasing Genius!\"\n \n  \"Well, I'll tell you something,\" said the mayor confidentially. \"When\nyou've got one thing, you've got one thing. But when you've got money,\nit's the same as having a lot of things. Because, if you've got money,\nyou can buy this and that and this and that and—\"\n \n  \"This and that,\" concluded Joe. \"We'll give you five hundred buckos.\"\n \n  \"Now, gents!\" Johnson remonstrated. \"Why, six hundred would hardly—\"\n \n  \"You haven't left us much money,\" Harvey put in.\n \n  The mayor frowned. \"All right, we'll split the difference. Make it\nfive-fifty.\"\n \n  Harvey was quick to pay out, for this was a genuine windfall. Then he\nstood up and admired the astonishing possession he had so inexpensively\nacquired.\n \n  \"I really hate to deprive you of this unique creature,\" he said to\nJohnson. \"I should imagine you will be rather lonely, with only your\nfilial mammoth to keep you company.\"\n \n  \"I sure will,\" Johnson confessed glumly. \"I got pretty attached to\nGenius, and I'm going to miss him something awful.\"\n \n  Harvey forcibly removed his eyes from the native, who was clearing off\nthe table almost all at once.\n \n  \"My friend,\" he said, \"we take your only solace, it is true, but in his\nplace we can offer something no less amazing and instructive.\"\n \n  The mayor's hand went protectively to his pocket. \"What is it?\" he\nasked with the suspicion of a man who has seen human nature at its\nworst and expects nothing better.\n \n  \"Joseph, get our most prized belonging from the communications room of\nthe ship,\" Harvey instructed. To Johnson he explained: \"You must see\nthe wondrous instrument before its value can be appreciated. My partner\nwill soon have it here for your astonishment.\"\n \n  Joe's face grew as glum as Johnson's had been. \"Aw, Harv,\" he\nprotested, \"do we have to sell it? And right when I thought we were\ngetting the key!\"\n \n  \"We must not be selfish, my boy,\" Harvey said nobly. \"We have had our\nchance; now we must relinquish Fate to the hands of a man who might\nhave more success than we. Go, Joseph. Bring it here.\"\n \n  Unwillingly, Joe turned and shuffled out.\nOn a larger and heavier world than Planetoid 42, Johnson's curiosity\nwould probably have had weight and mass. He was bursting with\nquestions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. For\nhis part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoeba\nuntil Joe came in, lugging a radio.\n \n  \"Is that what you were talking about?\" the mayor snorted. \"What makes\nyou think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers and\npolitical speech-makers.\"\n \n  \"Do not jump to hasty conclusions,\" Harvey cautioned. \"Another word,\nand I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had,\nwith the sole exceptions of Joseph, myself and the unfortunate inventor\nof this absolutely awe-inspiring device.\"\n \n  \"I ain't in the market for a radio,\" Johnson said stubbornly.\n \n  Harvey nodded in relief. \"We have attempted to repay our host, Joseph.\nHe has spurned our generosity. We have now the chance to continue our\nstudy, which I am positive will soon reward us with the key to an\nenormous fortune.\"\n \n  \"Well, that's no plating off our bow,\" Joe grunted. \"I'm glad he did\nturn it down. I hated to give it up after working on it for three whole\nyears.\"\n \n  He picked up the radio and began walking toward the door.\n \n  \"Now, hold on!\" the mayor cried. \"I ain't\nsaying\nI'll buy, but what\nis it I'm turning down?\"\n \n  Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar. His face\nsorrowful, Harvey fondly stroked the scarred plasticoid cabinet.\n \n  \"To make a long story, Mr. Johnson,\" he said, \"Joseph and I were among\nthe chosen few who knew the famous Doctor Dean intimately. Just before\nhis tragic death, you will recall, Dean allegedly went insane.\" He\nbanged his fist on the bar. \"I have said it before, and I repeat again,\nthat was a malicious lie, spread by the doctor's enemies to discredit\nhis greatest invention—this fourth dimensional radio!\"\n \n  \"This what?\" Johnson blurted out.\n \n  \"In simple terms,\" clarified Harvey, \"the ingenious doctor discovered\nthat the yawning chasm between the dimensions could be bridged by\nenergy of all quanta. There has never been any question that the\ninhabitants of the super-dimension would be far more civilized than\nourselves. Consequently, the man who could tap their knowledge would\nfind himself in possession of a powerful, undreamt-of science!\"\n \n  The mayor looked respectfully at the silent box on the bar.\n \n  \"And this thing gets broadcasts from the fourth dimension?\"\n \n  \"It does, Mr. Johnson! Only charlatans like those who envied Doctor\nDean's magnificent accomplishments could deny that fact.\"\n \n  The mayor put his hands in his pockets, unswiveled one hip and stared\nthoughtfully at the battered cabinet.\n \n  \"Well, let's say it picks up fourth dimensional broadcasts,\" he\nconceded. \"But how could you understand what they're saying? Folks up\nthere wouldn't talk our language.\"\n \n  Again Harvey smashed his fist down. \"Do you dare to repeat the scurvy\nlie that broke Dean's spirit and drove him to suicide?\"\n \n  Johnson recoiled. \"No—no,\nof course not\n. I mean, being up here, I\nnaturally couldn't get all the details.\"\n \n  \"Naturally,\" Harvey agreed, mollified. \"I'm sorry I lost my temper.\nBut it is a matter of record that the doctor proved the broadcasts\nemanating from the super-dimension were in English! Why should that be\nso difficult to believe? Is it impossible that at one time there was\ncommunication between the dimensions, that the super-beings admired\nour language and adopted it in all its beauty, adding to it their own\nhyper-scientific trimmings?\"\n \n  \"Why, I don't know,\" Johnson said in confusion.\n \n  \"For three years, Joseph and I lost sleep and hair, trying to detect\nthe simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosed\nbroadcasts into our primitive English. It eluded us. Even the doctor\nfailed. But that was understandable; a sensitive soul like his could\nstand only so much. And the combination of ridicule and failure to\nsolve the mystery caused him to take his own life.\"\n \n  Johnson winced. \"Is that what you want to unload on me?\"\n \n  \"For a very good reason, sir. Patience is the virtue that will be\nrewarded with the key to these fourth dimensional broadcasts. A man who\ncould devote his life to improving this lonely worldlet is obviously a\nperson with unusual patience.\"\n \n  \"Yeah,\" the mayor said grudgingly, \"I ain't exactly flighty.\"\n \n  \"Therefore, you are the man who could unravel the problem!\"\n \n  Johnson asked skeptically: \"How about a sample first?\"\nHarvey turned a knob on the face of the scarred radio. After several\nsqueals of spatial figures, a smooth voice began:\n \n  \"There are omnious pleajes of moby-hailegs in sonmirand which,\nhowgraismon, are notch to be donfured miss ellasellabell in either or\nboth hagasanipaj, by all means. This does not refly, on the brother\nman, nat or mizzafil saces are denuded by this ossifaligo....\"\n \n  Harvey switched off the set determinedly.\n \n  \"Wait a minute!\" Johnson begged. \"I almost got it then!\"\n \n  \"I dislike being commercial,\" said Harvey, \"but this astounding device\nstill belongs to us. Would we not be foolish to let you discover the\nclue before purchasing the right to do so?\"\n \n  The mayor nodded indecisively, looking at the radio with agonized\nlonging. \"How much do you want?\" he asked unhappily.\n \n  \"One thousand buckos, and no haggling. I am not in the mood.\"\n \n  Johnson opened his mouth to argue; then, seeing Harvey's set features,\npaid with the worst possible grace.\n \n  \"Don't you think we ought to tell him about the batteries, Harv?\" Joe\nasked.\n \n  \"What about the batteries?\" demanded Johnson with deadly calm.\n \n  \"A very small matter,\" Harvey said airily. \"You see, we have been\nanalyzing these broadcasts for three years. In that time, of course,\nthe batteries are bound to weaken. I estimate these should last not\nless than one Terrestrial month, at the very least.\"\n \n  \"What do I do then?\"\n \n  Harvey shrugged. \"Special batteries are required, which I see Joseph\nhas by chance brought along. For the batteries, the only ones of their\nkind left in the system, I ask only what they cost—one hundred and\nninety-nine buckos, no more and, on the other hand, no less.\"\n \n  Johnson was breathing hard, and his hand hovered dangerously near his\ngun. But he paid the amount Harvey wanted.\n \n  Moreover, he actually shook hands when the two panacea purveyors\ncollected their six-armed prize and said goodbye. Before they were\noutside, however, he had turned on the radio and was listening tensely\nto a woman's highly cultured, though rather angry voice, saying:\n \n  \"Oh, you hannaforge are all beasa-taga-sanimort. If you rue amount it,\nhow do you respench a pure woman to ansver go-samak—\"\n \n  \"I'll get it!\" they heard Johnson mutter.\n \n  Then the sound of giant feet crossing the barroom floor reached their\nears, and a shrill question: \"What's that, Papa?\"\n \n  \"A fortune, Jed! Those fakers are damned fools, selling us a thing\nlike—\"\n \n  Joe gazed at Harvey admiringly. \"Another one sold? Harv, that spiel\npulls them in like an ether storm!\"\n \n  Together with the remarkable planetoid man, they reached the ship.\nAbove them, dark, tumbling shapes blotted out the stars and silently\nmoved on. Joe opened the gangway door.\n \n  \"Come on in, pal,\" he said to Genius. \"We're shoving off.\"\n \n  The planetoid man grinned foolishly. \"Can't go arong with you,\" he said\nwith an apologetic manner. \"I rike to, but pressure fratten me out if I\ngo.\"\n \n  \"What in solar blazes are you talking about?\" Harvey asked.\n \n  \"I grow up on pranetoid,\" Genius explained. \"On big pranet, too much\npressure for me.\"\n \n  The two salesmen looked narrowly at each other.\n \n  \"Did Johnson know that when he sold you?\" Joe snarled.\n \n  \"Oh, sure.\" The silly grin became wider than ever. \"Peopre from Earth\nbuy me rots of times. I never reave pranetoid, though.\"\n \n  \"Joseph,\" Harvey said ominously, \"that slick colonist has put one over\nupon us. What is our customary procedure in that event?\"\n \n  \"We tear him apart,\" Joe replied between his teeth.\n \n  \"Not Mister Johnson,\" advised Genius. \"Have gun and badge. He shoot you\nfirst and then rock you up in prison.\"\n \n  Harvey paused, his ominous air vanishing. \"True. There is also the\nfact, Joseph, that when he discovers the scrambled rectifier in\nthe radio we sold him, he will have been paid back in full for his\nregrettable dishonesty.\"\nUnwillingly, Joe agreed. While Genius retreated to a safe distance,\nthey entered the ship and blasted off. Within a few minutes the\nautomatic steering pilot had maneuvered them above the plane of the\nasteroid belt.\n \n  \"I got kind of dizzy,\" Joe said, \"there were so many deals back and\nforth. How much did we make on the sucker?\"\n \n  \"A goodly amount, I wager,\" Harvey responded. He took out a pencil and\npaper. \"Medicine, 469.50; radio, 1,000; batteries, 199. Total—let's\nsee—1668 buckos and 50 redsents. A goodly sum, as I told you.\"\n \n  He emptied his pockets of money, spread it out on the astrogation table\nand began counting. Finished, he looked up, troubled.\n \n  \"How much did we have when we landed, Joseph?\"\n \n  \"Exactly 1668 buckos,\" Joe answered promptly.\n \n  \"I can't understand it,\" said Harvey. \"Instead of double our capital,\nwe now have only 1668 buckos and 50 redsents!\"\n \n  Feverishly, he returned to his pencil and paper.\n \n  \"Drinking water, 790; battery water, free; meal, 328; planetoid man,\n550. Total: 1668 buckos!\" He stared at the figures. \"We paid out almost\nas much as we took in,\" he said bitterly. \"Despite our intensive\nefforts, we made the absurd sum of fifty redsents.\"\n \n  \"Why, the dirty crook!\" Joe growled.\n \n  But after a few moments of sad reflection, Harvey became philosophical.\n\"Perhaps, Joseph, we are more fortunate than we realize. We were,\nafter all, completely in Johnson's power. The more I ponder, the more\nI believe we were lucky to escape. And, anyhow, we did make fifty\nredsents on the swindler. A moral victory, my boy.\"\n \n  Joe, who had been sunk desparingly into a chair, now stood up slowly\nand asked: \"Remember that bottle-opener we gave him?\"\n \n  \"Certainly,\" Harvey explained. \"What about it?\"\n \n  \"How much did it cost us?\"\n \n  Harvey's eyebrows puckered. Suddenly he started laughing. \"You're\nright, Joseph. We paid forty-six redsents for it on Venus. So, after\nall that transacting of business, we made four redsents!\"\n \n  \"Four redsents, hell!\" Joe snapped. \"That was the sales tax!\"\n \n  He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. \"You remember those yokels on\nMars' Flatlands, and the way they worshipped gold?\"\n \n  \"\nGoldbricks!\n\" Harvey said succinctly.\n \n  Grinning, Joe set the robot-controls for Mars.\n",

They tell the bartender, Johnson, that they’re very thirsty, so he sells them each eight glasses of water, and they guzzle them down. Harvey and Joe are horrified to find out that the water is highly expensive. Johnson explains that the water must be purified. When the pair leaves, they find a pipe in a small pond and realize that Johnson has undoubtedly swindled them. The sweet water is readily available and it is transported directly to the saloon via this pipe. \n\nHarvey and Joe head back to the bar. Joe comes down with a sudden illness, and it’s clear that this is a con the men use all the time. Johnson recognizes that Joe has asteroid fever and becomes frightened. Harvey explains that the only medication that will provide an instant cure is the one they happen to be selling: La-anago Yergis.\n\nJoe is instantly cured once Harvey pours the special liquid into his mouth. Johnson is flabbergasted and wants to purchase an entire case. While in the privacy of their ship, Joe and Harvey discuss their joint desire to purchase Genius. They believe they could make a fortune off of him if they featured him in an exhibit. \n\nJohnson accepts the fake solution and informs Harvey and Joe that his restaurant is open. After looking at the menu, the men are astounded at the low prices. However, they soon find out that they have been taken advantage of when they receive a bill for a very large sum of money. They learn that the fine print they missed on the menu explains the charge. When Joe tells Johnson they won’t pay the bill, Johnson reminds them that he is in fact the Sheriff as well as the saloon owner and the mayor. \n\nHarvey requests to purchase Genius, and Johnson agrees. In a last ditch effort to recoup some more money, Harvey brings up an invention they have on their ship that Johnson must see. Joe brings back a radio that was supposedly created by a famous doctor. It is special because it broadcasts from the fourth dimension. They convince Johnson that he is the perfect person to make sense of the garbled transmissions. Johnson pays extra for the special batteries it takes.\n\nJust as Harvey and Joe make it back to the ship with Genius, the creature informs them that he cannot leave the planet because another planet’s pressure would squish him to death. And yes, he admits, Johnson was fully aware of this fact when he sold him. \n\nWhen Harvey does the math involved in the various exchanges of goods, he realizes that after all that time and the several cons they engaged in, he and Joe made a measly four cents. The men take off on their ship and head to Mars. \n\n"

These solar salesmen travel the galaxy selling their miraculous elixir, which isn’t so miraculous after all. They find water and are served by Johnson, the barmen, sheriff, and general chief of the land. After drinking eight glasses, their thirst is quenched and they’re ready to pay. At the sight of the large check, they are rightfully appalled, until Johnson explains the reason behind it. The water on this planet is so bitter that it must undergo a rigorous purification process to make it drinkable. Harvey and Joe believe him and pay their sum. They ask if they can fill up the water tank for their spaceship as well, and Johnson points them to the pond. The water there is bitter, but they haul it back and forth. Joe notices a reflection not too far from them and discovers another pond with sweet drinkable water. They realize that they’ve been conned by Johnson. \nThey rush back to the bar to confront him when they meet his son, Jed. Jed is huge, and Harvey and Joe abandon their plan. Quickly, Harvey changes course and asks Jed if he’s feeling ill. Jed feigns illness and collapses, while Johnson assumes it’s the notorious asteroid fever. Harvey rushes to the ship to grab their miraculous cure and forces Joe to drink it. He rises, convincing Johnson of its powers. Johnson quickly asks to buy cases of it, and Harvey agrees, supplying it at a great price. The men run back to the ship to prepare the vials. Harvey is supplementing them with the bitter water, so they save more snake oil. \nJohnson invites them to eat at his restaurant when they return with the medicine. He cons them yet again here by including a hefty fee at the bottom of the paycheck for the entertainment that Genius provided. \nHarvey and Joe still decide to barter further and arrange a monetary transaction in exchange for Genius. Johnson agrees though he admits he will miss him. At this, Harvey decides on one last con and sends Joe to pick up their most prized possession. A radio that can reach the fourth dimension. Johnson buys into it and sits down to attempt to translate garbled English. Harvey, Joe, and Genius leave quickly before Johnson realizes the radio is nothing more than tomfoolery. \nHowever, the last con is played on Harvey and Joe, as Genius reveals he is unable to leave this planet due to atmospheric pressure differences. Harvey and Joe leave him behind. \nThey count their money and realize they haven’t made any real profit. \n"

They find a saloon manned by a six-armed life-form and a bartender named Johnson. Harvey and Joe ask for water, which they get, but are charged forty buckos, presumably because there is a high price to get water filtered in this area. The men are astounded but Harvey tries to be understanding of the unusual situation, and pays Johnson the money he asks for. It turns out that Johnson is not just the bartender, but also the mayor, among other jobs. He works out a deal for the men to fill their tanks with purified water, claims to give them a bargain price, and sends his assistant out to the pumps to help the men. Although purified water is expensive, unpurified water used as battery fluid is free, and Johnson points the men to the body of water where they can find what they need. As Joe and Harvey are collecting battery water, they find pipes that carry purified water to the saloon from a clean pool—Johnson had lied about the purification system, and thus charged them way more than the water was worth (twice), so Harvey decides they need revenge. Joe pretends to get asteroid fever, which terrifies Johnson, and Harvey concocts a fake medicine using some of the bitter water to convince Johnson to buy a case from him. The back-and-forth of cons continues: Johnson lures them into a meal with inexpensive food but an expensive hidden surcharge for service and entertainment. Then, Harvey “convinces” Johnson to sell him Genius, his assistant, and Joe and Harvey convince Johnson to buy a radio that they inserted a scrambler into, claiming it had hidden knowledge from the fourth dimension. This whole time, Johnson acts as though he doesn’t have any interest in things he wants to buy, for as long as he can maintain that appearance. However, Joe and Harvey will often get him interested by the end, with Johnson becoming upset when he can’t have what he wants. In the end, it turns out Genius can’t actually leave Planetoid 42, because he would be crushed by a larger planet’s gravity, and Joe and Harvey leave somewhat dejected, hoping that they managed to make some amount of money from the whole ordeal. It turns out they broke exactly even, so they had a good laugh of frustration and went on to Mars to try another plan.\n\n"

They make their money by peddling a fake panacea called La-anago Yergis. The men regularly partake in an act where Joe falls ill and Harvey has to come to his rescue with the extract. Although Johnson falls for this trick and purchases an entire case of the medicine, he also does a great job of getting Harvey and Joe back. At the end of the story, the opposing sides come out basically even in terms of financial gains. \n\nJohnson first demonstrates that he can take advantage of Harvey and Joe when he gives them each eight glasses of water before letting them know that he charges a lot for each glass. The men say they’re thirsty, so he is happy to give them as much as they’d like to drink. Although Johnson says that the water costs so much because it must be specially purified, the truth is that he has access to an entire body of water and there really isn’t any reason to charge so much.\n\nLater, Johnson convinces Harvey and Joe that they’re hungry enough to sit down at his restaurant even though neither one had even mentioned food. He allows them to order their food and believe that they’re getting an incredible deal until he tells them about the fine print on the menu. Harvey and Joe are forced to fork over hundreds of dollars for their meal, and when they threaten to walk out, Johnson reminds them that he is the sheriff on Planetoid 42, and he has the power to arrest them. \n"

He initially charges them for water that he claims is expensively purified when in fact it is naturally drinkable. He overcharges them for a meal using a menu with ludicrously fine print. Finally he sells them Genius even though they can't take him off world. In the end Johnson proves that he is just a good a grifter as Harvey and Joe because he manages to extract exactly as much money out of the pair as they do out of him."

From the get-go, we know that these men are scheming cons, but Johnson is the first to make a move. He cons them into paying more for the water than was necessary and from there the battle only grows. \nWith every con Joe and Harvey pull, Johnson is right back with them. Although they may stump him in the end with the ingenious radio that picks up the fourth dimension, he got the last laugh what with Genius being unable to leave. \nAs well, when Joe and Harvey count their money in the end, they realize they’re leaving with the same amount they arrived with. Johnson was not only a formidable foe but possibly their equal in terms of scheming qualities.\n"

Joe and Harvey think that they are excellent conmen; they say they are salesman who are traveling, but show throughout the story that they are the type to find the best deal for themselves in any way possible. Johnson, the man who runs the bar and the legal system on Planetoid 42, is ready to rise to the occasion. In fact, at the end of the story, they break even and neither side has actually gained any money. Whenever Joe and Harvey are trying to pull one of their scams, Johnson maintains an uninterested air and tries to not give away any interest in anything the visitors may have to sell him. He always acts as if he needs to be convinced by something, and does not let on what he is trying to pull something over on Joe and Harvey. He also finds very sneaky ways of getting money from them, playing on the visitors’ limited knowledge of the planetoid and its environment. This is how he originally sells them on the idea that he has to charge for water, but it is not his only tactic. He presents them with a menu that has very inexpensive prices for food, but does not mention the extremely small print on the bottom of the menu that shows an exorbitant service charge for the entertainment. These types of ploys have something in common: he tries to set up a situation to make it look very normal for his environment on the planetoid, but hides the information necessary for visitors to make an informed decision. This includes selling Genius near the end of the story, which is a con he has apparently run many times. Because he expects visitors to not think about the biology of the creatures who live on the planetoid, he is able to sell the flashy exterior, in this case his assistant’s capabilities, while there is always a hidden piece of information underneath."

It is home to only two humans, Johnson and his son Jeb, and Genius, a fantastic creature with six limbs that is unlike anything Joe and Harvey have ever seen before. The planet has gravity, which made it possible for Jed to grow to eight feet tall. Genius is also able to thrive on Planetoid 42 while he would perish on other planets with more gravity. \n\nAlthough Johnson says that the water must be purified so it doesn’t taste bitter, the truth is that there’s a large pool with sweet water on the planet. Johnson insists that he has to charge a lot of money for water in part because he has very few customers. The planet is mostly deserted and people only show up to his bar if they’re in trouble.Johnson makes the rules because he is in charge of everything. He is the sheriff, fire chief, mayor, justice of the peace, and restaurateur. "

Due to its small size and remote location, there are no radios or satellites that Johnson can use to catch up on political battles or other earthly drama. \nThere are two water sources, one which is bitter and must be purified to drink, and the other which is sweet and fresh. \nThere’s no mechanic or any other repairman on this planet.

Because it is small, the gravitational pull is much lower than the larger planets that humans are used to. It is not very well developed in the sense of infrastructure, and there are not many buildings—in fact, only two humans live there, Johnson and his son, although Genius grew up on the planetoid. The saloon is where we encounter our protagonists for the first time, and it is located on a poorly kept stretch of land covered in trash. Outside of the saloon are the water tanks where Johnson keeps his filtered water to sell the people passing through. There are at least two bodies of water outside, one with bitter water that is used for battery fluid, and one that has clean water that Johnson keeps a secret. These locations are connected through sets of pipes that allow Johnson to keep his freshwater tanks full. Most of the story takes place inside the saloon itself. It is at the bar where Joe and Harvey found water to drink at the beginning of the story, this is the bar that Joe lies on when he pretends to have asteroid fever, and this was the area that served as the restaurant where they ate. A few scenes take place inside of Joe and Harvey’s ship, as they eventually leave Planetoid 42, but also when Harvey pulled the medicine con."
