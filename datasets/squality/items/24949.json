      "content": "\"Any problem posed by one group of\n human beings can be resolved by any\n other group.\" That's what the Handbook\n said. But did that include primitive\n humans? Or the Bees? Or a ...\n \n \n CONTROL GROUP\n \n\n By ROGER DEE\n \n\n The\n cool green disk of Alphard\n Six on the screen was\n infinitely welcome after the arid\n desolation and stinking swamplands\n of the inner planets, an\n airy jewel of a world that might\n have been designed specifically\n for the hard-earned month of\n rest ahead. Navigator Farrell,\n youngest and certainly most impulsive\n of the three-man Terran\n Reclamations crew, would have\n set the Marco Four down at\n once but for the greater caution\n of Stryker, nominally captain of\n the group, and of Gibson, engineer,\n and linguist. Xavier, the\n ship's little mechanical, had—as\n was usual and proper—no voice\n in the matter.\n \n \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\n Arthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\n chuckled at Farrell's instant\n scowl, his little eyes twinkling\n and his naked paunch quaking\n over the belt of his shipboard\n shorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\n Five, Paragraph Twenty-seven: No planetfall on an unreclaimed\n world shall be deemed\n safe without proper— \"\n \n Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\n interrupted with characteristic\n impatience. \"Do you sleep with that damned Reclamations\n Handbook, Lee? Alphard Six\n isn't an unreclaimed world—it\n was never colonized before the\n Hymenop invasion back in 3025,\n so why should it be inhabited\n now?\"\n \n Gibson, who for four hours\n had not looked up from his interminable\n chess game with\n Xavier, paused with a beleaguered\n knight in one blunt brown\n hand.\n \n \"No point in taking chances,\"\n Gibson said in his neutral baritone.\n He shrugged thick bare\n shoulders, his humorless black-browed\n face unmoved, when\n Farrell included him in his\n scowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\n light-years from Sol, at\n the old limits of Terran expansion,\n and there's no knowing\n what we may turn up here. Alphard's\n was one of the first systems\n the Bees took over. It must\n have been one of the last to be\n abandoned when they pulled back\n to 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n \n \"And I think you live for the\n day,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\n we'll stumble across a functioning\n dome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\n Damn it, Gib, the Bees\n pulled out a hundred years ago,\n before you and I were born—neither\n of us ever saw a Hymenop,\n and never will!\"\n \n \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\n said. \"I fought them for the better\n part of the century they were\n here, and I learned there's no\n predicting nor understanding\n them. We never knew why they\n came nor why they gave up and\n left. How can we know whether\n they'd leave a rear-guard or\n booby trap here?\"\n \n He put a paternal hand on\n Farrell's shoulder, understanding\n the younger man's eagerness\n and knowing that their close-knit\n team would have been the\n more poorly balanced without it.\n \n \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\n nearly added as usual . \"We're on\n rest leave at the moment, yes,\n but our mission is still to find\n Terran colonies enslaved and\n abandoned by the Bees, not to\n risk our necks and a valuable\n Reorientations ship by landing\n blind on an unobserved planet.\n We're too close already. Cut in\n your shields and find a reconnaissance\n spiral, will you?\"\n \n Grumbling, Farrell punched\n coordinates on the Ringwave\n board that lifted the Marco Four out of her descent and restored\n the bluish enveloping haze of\n her repellors.\n \n Stryker's caution was justified\n on the instant. The speeding\n streamlined shape that had flashed\n up unobserved from below\n swerved sharply and exploded in\n a cataclysmic blaze of atomic\n fire that rocked the ship wildly\n and flung the three men to the\n floor in a jangling roar of\n alarms.\n \n \n \n \"So the Handbook tacticians\n knew what they were about,\"\n Stryker said minutes later. Deliberately\n he adopted the smug\n tone best calculated to sting Farrell\n out of his first self-reproach,\n and grinned when the navigator\n bristled defensively. \"Some of\n their enjoinders seem a little\n stuffy and obvious at times, but\n they're eminently sensible.\"\n \n When Farrell refused to be\n baited Stryker turned to Gibson,\n who was busily assessing the\n damage done to the ship's more\n fragile equipment, and to Xavier,\n who searched the planet's\n surface with the ship's magnoscanner.\n The Marco Four , Ringwave\n generators humming gently,\n hung at the moment just\n inside the orbit of Alphard Six's\n single dun-colored moon.\n \n Gibson put down a test meter\n with an air of finality.\n \n \"Nothing damaged but the\n Zero Interval Transfer computer.\n I can realign that in a couple\n of hours, but it'll have to be\n done before we hit Transfer\n again.\"\n \n \n \n Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\n the ZIT unit is repaired?\n Suppose they come up after us?\"\n \n \"I doubt that they can. Any\n installation crudely enough\n equipped to trust in guided missiles\n is hardly likely to have developed\n efficient space craft.\"\n \n Stryker was not reassured.\n \n \"That torpedo of theirs was\n deadly enough,\" he said. \"And\n its nature reflects the nature of\n the people who made it. Any race\n vicious enough to use atomic\n charges is too dangerous to\n trifle with.\" Worry made comical\n creases in his fat, good-humored\n face. \"We'll have to find\n out who they are and why\n they're here, you know.\"\n \n \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\n Gibson said promptly. \"First,\n because the Bees pinned their\n faith on Ringwave energy fields,\n as we did, rather than on missiles.\n Second, because there's no\n dome on Six.\"\n \n \"There were three empty\n domes on Five, which is a desert\n planet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\n a more habitable world.\"\n \n Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\n Bees always erected domes on\n every planet they colonized, Arthur,\n but precedent is a fallible\n tool. And it's even more firmly\n established that there's no possibility\n of our rationalizing the\n motivations of a culture as alien\n as the Hymenops'—we've been\n over that argument a hundred\n times on other reclaimed\n worlds.\"\n \n \"But this was never an unreclaimed\n world,\" Farrell said\n with the faint malice of one too\n recently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\n seeded with Terran bacteria\n around the year 3000, but the\n Bees invaded before we could\n colonize. And that means we'll\n have to rule out any resurgent\n colonial group down there, because\n Six never had a colony in\n the beginning.\"\n \n \"The Bees have been gone for\n over a hundred years,\" Stryker\n said. \"Colonists might have migrated\n from another Terran-occupied\n planet.\"\n \n Gibson disagreed.\n \n \"We've touched at every inhabited\n world in this sector, Lee,\n and not one surviving colony has\n developed space travel on its\n own. The Hymenops had a hundred\n years to condition their human\n slaves to ignorance of\n everything beyond their immediate\n environment—the motives\n behind that conditioning usually\n escape us, but that's beside the\n point—and they did a thorough\n job of it. The colonists have had\n no more than a century of freedom\n since the Bees pulled out,\n and four generations simply\n isn't enough time for any subjugated\n culture to climb from\n slavery to interstellar flight.\"\n \n Stryker made a padding turn\n about the control room, tugging\n unhappily at the scanty fringe\n of hair the years had left him.\n \n \"If they're neither Hymenops\n nor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining—they're\n aliens from a\n system we haven't reached yet,\n beyond the old sphere of Terran\n exploration. We always assumed\n that we'd find other races out\n here someday, and that they'd\n be as different from us in form\n and motivation as the Hymenops.\n Why not now?\"\n \n Gibson said seriously, \"Not\n probable, Lee. The same objection\n that rules out the Bees applies\n to any trans-Alphardian\n culture—they'd have to be beyond\n the atomic fission stage,\n else they'd never have attempted\n interstellar flight. The Ringwave\n with its Zero Interval Transfer\n principle and instantaneous communications\n applications is the\n only answer to long-range travel,\n and if they'd had that they\n wouldn't have bothered with\n atomics.\"\n \n Stryker turned on him almost\n angrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\n or humans or aliens, then\n what in God's name are they?\"\n \n \n \n \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\n said, quoting a passage\n whose aptness had somehow seen\n it through a dozen reorganizations\n of insular tongue and a\n final translation to universal\n Terran. \"If they're none of those\n three, we've only one conclusion\n left. There's no one down there\n at all—we're victims of the first\n joint hallucination in psychiatric\n history.\"\n \n Stryker threw up his hands in\n surrender. \"We can't identify\n them by theorizing, and that\n brings us down to the business\n of first-hand investigation.\n Who's going to bell the cat this\n time?\"\n \n \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\n at once. \"The ZIT computer can\n wait.\"\n \n Stryker vetoed his offer as\n promptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\n first. We may have to run for it,\n and we can't set up a Transfer\n jump without the computer. It's\n got to be me or Arthur.\"\n \n Farrell felt the familiar chill\n of uneasiness that inevitably\n preceded this moment of decision.\n He was not lacking in courage,\n else the circumstances under\n which he had worked for the\n past ten years—the sometimes\n perilous, sometimes downright\n charnel conditions left by the\n fleeing Hymenop conquerors—would\n have broken him long\n ago. But that same hard experience\n had honed rather than\n blunted the edge of his imagination,\n and the prospect of a close-quarters\n stalking of an unknown\n and patently hostile force was\n anything but attractive.\n \n \"You two did the field work\n on the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn—and\n God knows I'd go mad if\n I had to stay inship and listen\n to Lee memorizing his Handbook\n subsections or to Gib practicing\n dead languages with Xavier.\"\n \n Stryker laughed for the first\n time since the explosion that\n had so nearly wrecked the Marco\n Four .\n \n \"Good enough. Though it\n wouldn't be more diverting to\n listen for hours to you improvising\n enharmonic variations on\n the Lament for Old Terra with\n your accordion.\"\n \n Gibson, characteristically, had\n a refinement to offer.\n \n \"They'll be alerted down there\n for a reconnaissance sally,\" he\n said. \"Why not let Xavier take\n the scouter down for overt diversion,\n and drop Arthur off in\n the helihopper for a low-level\n check?\"\n \n Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\n right, Arthur?\"\n \n \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\n And to Xavier, who had not\n moved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\n Xav? Have you pinned down\n their base yet?\"\n \n The mechanical answered him\n in a voice as smooth and clear—and\n as inflectionless—as a 'cello\n note. \"The planet seems uninhabited\n except for a large island\n some three hundred miles in\n diameter. There are twenty-seven\n small agrarian hamlets surrounded\n by cultivated fields.\n There is one city of perhaps a\n thousand buildings with a central\n square. In the square rests\n a grounded spaceship of approximately\n ten times the bulk\n of the Marco Four .\"\n \n They crowded about the vision\n screen, jostling Xavier's jointed\n gray shape in their interest. The\n central city lay in minutest detail\n before them, the battered\n hulk of the grounded ship glinting\n rustily in the late afternoon\n sunlight. Streets radiated away\n from the square in orderly succession,\n the whole so clearly\n depicted that they could see the\n throngs of people surging up\n and down, tiny foreshortened\n faces turned toward the sky.\n \n \"At least they're human,\"\n Farrell said. Relief replaced in\n some measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\n Terran, and can be dealt with\n according to Reclamations routine.\n Is that hulk spaceworthy,\n Xav?\"\n \n Xavier's mellow drone assumed\n the convention vibrato that\n indicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\n breached hull makes the ship incapable\n of flight. Apparently it\n is used only to supply power to\n the outlying hamlets.\"\n \n The mechanical put a flexible\n gray finger upon an indicator\n graph derived from a composite\n section of detector meters. \"The\n power transmitted seems to be\n gross electric current conveyed\n by metallic cables. It is generated\n through a crudely governed\n process of continuous atomic\n fission.\"\n \n \n \n Farrell, himself appalled by\n the information, still found himself\n able to chuckle at Stryker's\n bellow of consternation.\n \n \" Continuous fission? Good\n God, only madmen would deliberately\n run a risk like that!\"\n \n Farrell prodded him with\n cheerful malice. \"Why say mad men ? Maybe they're humanoid\n aliens who thrive on hard radiation\n and look on the danger of\n being blown to hell in the middle\n of the night as a satisfactory\n risk.\"\n \n \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\n said positively. \"Their architecture\n is Terran, and so is their\n ship. The ship is incredibly\n primitive, though; those batteries\n of tubes at either end—\"\n \n \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\n Stryker finished in an awed\n voice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\n Gib—the thing is prehistoric!\n Rocket propulsion hasn't been\n used in spacecraft since—how\n long, Xav?\"\n \n Xavier supplied the information\n with mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\n the Ringwave propulsion-communication\n principle was discovered.\n That principle has served\n men since.\"\n \n Farrell stared in blank disbelief\n at the anomalous craft on\n the screen. Primitive, as Stryker\n had said, was not the word\n for it: clumsily ovoid, studded\n with torpedo domes and turrets\n and bristling at either end with\n propulsion tubes, it lay at the\n center of its square like a rusted\n relic of a past largely destroyed\n and all but forgotten. What a\n magnificent disregard its builders\n must have had, he thought,\n for their lives and the genetic\n purity of their posterity! The\n sullen atomic fires banked in\n that oxidizing hulk—\n \n Stryker said plaintively, \"If\n you're right, Gib, then we're\n more in the dark than ever. How\n could a Terran-built ship eleven\n hundred years old get here ?\"\n \n Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\n contemplation of alternatives,\n seemed hardly to hear\n him.\n \n \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\n said. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\n we can discover the reason for\n its presence. If not—\"\n \n \" Any problem posed by one\n group of human beings ,\" Stryker\n quoted his Handbook, \" can be\n resolved by any other group, regardless\n of ideology or conditioning,\n because the basic\n perceptive abilities of both must\n be the same through identical\n heredity .\"\n \n \"If it's an imitation, and this\n is another Hymenop experiment\n in condition ecology, then we're\n stumped to begin with,\" Gibson\n finished. \"Because we're not\n equipped to evaluate the psychology\n of alien motivation. We've\n got to determine first which case\n applies here.\"\n \n \n \n He waited for Farrell's expected\n irony, and when the\n navigator forestalled him by remaining\n grimly quiet, continued.\n \n \"The obvious premise is that\n a Terran ship must have been\n built by Terrans. Question: Was\n it flown here, or built here?\"\n \n \"It couldn't have been built\n here,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\n Six was surveyed just before the\n Bees took over in 3025, and there\n was nothing of the sort here\n then. It couldn't have been built\n during the two and a quarter\n centuries since; it's obviously\n much older than that. It was\n flown here.\"\n \n \"We progress,\" Farrell said\n dryly. \"Now if you'll tell us how ,\n we're ready to move.\"\n \n \"I think the ship was built on\n Terra during the Twenty-second\n Century,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\n period destroyed practically all\n historical records along with the\n technology of the time, but I've\n read well-authenticated reports\n of atomic-driven ships leaving\n Terra before then for the nearer\n stars. The human race climbed\n out of its pit again during the\n Twenty-third Century and developed\n the technology that gave\n us the Ringwave. Certainly no\n atomic-powered ships were built\n after the wars—our records are\n complete from that time.\"\n \n Farrell shook his head at the\n inference. \"I've read any number\n of fanciful romances on the\n theme, Gib, but it won't stand\n up in practice. No shipboard society\n could last through a thousand-year\n space voyage. It's a\n physical and psychological impossibility.\n There's got to be\n some other explanation.\"\n \n \n \n Gibson shrugged. \"We can\n only eliminate the least likely\n alternatives and accept the simplest\n one remaining.\"\n \n \"Then we can eliminate this\n one now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\n entails a thousand-year voyage,\n which is an impossibility for any\n gross reaction drive; the application\n of suspended animation\n or longevity or a successive-generation\n program, and a final\n penetration of Hymenop-occupied\n space to set up a colony under\n the very antennae of the\n Bees. Longevity wasn't developed\n until around the year 3000—Lee\n here was one of the first to\n profit by it, if you remember—and\n suspended animation is still\n to come. So there's one theory\n you can forget.\"\n \n \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\n reluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\n ship couldn't have made such a\n trip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\n project couldn't have\n lasted through forty generations,\n speculative fiction to the\n contrary—the later generations\n would have been too far removed\n in ideology and intent from\n their ancestors. They'd have\n adapted to shipboard life as the\n norm. They'd have atrophied\n physically, perhaps even have\n mutated—\"\n \n \"And they'd never have\n fought past the Bees during the\n Hymenop invasion and occupation,\"\n Farrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\n detection equipment than we\n had. They'd have picked this\n ship up long before it reached\n Alphard Six.\"\n \n \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\n now. Therefore it must have arrived\n at some time during the\n two hundred years of Hymenop\n occupation and evacuation.\"\n \n Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\n swore bitterly. \"But\n why should the Bees let them\n through? The three domes on\n Five are over two hundred years\n old, which means that the Bees\n were here before the ship came.\n Why didn't they blast it or enslave\n its crew?\"\n \n \"We haven't touched on all the\n possibilities,\" Gibson reminded\n him. \"We haven't even established\n yet that these people were\n never under Hymenop control.\n Precedent won't hold always, and\n there's no predicting nor evaluating\n the motives of an alien\n race. We never understood the\n Hymenops because there's no\n common ground of logic between\n us. Why try to interpret their\n intentions now?\"\n \n Farrell threw up his hands in\n disgust. \"Next you'll say this is\n an ancient Terran expedition\n that actually succeeded! There's\n only one way to answer the\n questions we've raised, and\n that's to go down and see for\n ourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n \n \n \n But uncertainty nagged uneasily\n at him when Farrell found\n himself alone in the helihopper\n with the forest flowing beneath\n like a leafy river and Xavier's\n scouter disappearing bulletlike\n into the dusk ahead.\n \n We never found a colony so\n advanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\n this is a Hymenop experiment\n that really paid off? The\n Bees did some weird and wonderful\n things with human\n guinea pigs—what if they've\n created the ultimate booby trap\n here, and primed it with conditioned\n myrmidons in our own\n form?\n \n Suppose, he thought—and derided\n himself for thinking it—one\n of those suicidal old interstellar\n ventures did succeed?\n \n Xavier's voice, a mellow\n drone from the helihopper's\n Ringwave-powered visicom, cut\n sharply into his musing. \"The\n ship has discovered the scouter\n and is training an electronic\n beam upon it. My instruments\n record an electromagnetic vibration\n pattern of low power but\n rapidly varying frequency. The\n operation seems pointless.\"\n \n Stryker's voice followed, querulous\n with worry: \"I'd better\n pull Xav back. It may be something\n lethal.\"\n \n \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\n Surprisingly, there was\n excitement in the engineer's\n voice. \"I think they're trying to\n communicate with us.\"\n \n Farrell was on the point of\n demanding acidly to know how\n one went about communicating\n by means of a fluctuating electric\n field when the unexpected\n cessation of forest diverted his\n attention. The helihopper scudded\n over a cultivated area\n of considerable extent, fields\n stretching below in a vague random\n checkerboard of lighter and\n darker earth, an undefined cluster\n of buildings at their center.\n There was a central bonfire that\n burned like a wild red eye\n against the lower gloom, and in\n its plunging ruddy glow he made\n out an urgent scurrying of shadowy\n figures.\n \n \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\n Farrell reported. \"The one nearest\n the city, I think. There's\n something odd going on\n down—\"\n \n Catastrophe struck so suddenly\n that he was caught completely\n unprepared. The helihopper's\n flimsy carriage bucked and\n crumpled. There was a blinding\n flare of electric discharge, a\n pungent stink of ozone and a\n stunning shock that flung him\n headlong into darkness.\n \n \n \n He awoke slowly with a brutal\n headache and a conviction of\n nightmare heightened by the\n outlandish tone of his surroundings.\n He lay on a narrow bed in\n a whitely antiseptic infirmary,\n an oblong metal cell cluttered\n with a grimly utilitarian array\n of tables and lockers and chests.\n The lighting was harsh and\n overbright and the air hung\n thick with pungent unfamiliar\n chemical odors. From somewhere,\n far off yet at the same\n time as near as the bulkhead\n above him, came the unceasing\n drone of machinery.\n \n Farrell sat up, groaning,\n when full consciousness made his\n position clear. He had been shot\n down by God knew what sort of\n devastating unorthodox weapon\n and was a prisoner in the\n grounded ship.\n \n At his rising, a white-smocked\n fat man with anachronistic spectacles\n and close-cropped gray\n hair came into the room, moving\n with the professional assurance\n of a medic. The man stopped\n short at Farrell's stare and\n spoke; his words were utterly\n unintelligible, but his gesture\n was unmistakable.\n \n Farrell followed him dumbly\n out of the infirmary and down\n a bare corridor whose metal\n floor rang coldly underfoot. An\n open port near the corridor's end\n relieved the blankness of wall\n and let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\n sunlight; Farrell slowed\n to look out, wondering how\n long he had lain unconscious,\n and felt panic knife at him\n when he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\n port open and undefended,\n on the square outside.\n \n The mechanical had been as\n easily taken as himself, then.\n Stryker and Gibson, for all their\n professional caution, would fare\n no better—they could not have\n overlooked the capture of Farrell\n and Xavier, and when they\n tried as a matter of course to\n rescue them the Marco would be\n struck down in turn by the same\n weapon.\n \n The fat medic turned and\n said something urgent in his\n unintelligible tongue. Farrell,\n dazed by the enormity of what\n had happened, followed without\n protest into an intersecting way\n that led through a bewildering\n succession of storage rooms and\n hydroponics gardens, through a\n small gymnasium fitted with\n physical training equipment in\n graduated sizes and finally into\n a soundproofed place that could\n have been nothing but a nursery.\n \n The implication behind its\n presence stopped Farrell short.\n \n \"A creche ,\" he said, stunned.\n He had a wild vision of endless\n generations of children growing\n up in this dim and stuffy room,\n to be taught from their first\n toddling steps the functions they\n must fulfill before the venture\n of which they were a part could\n be consummated.\n \n One of those old ventures had succeeded, he thought, and was\n awed by the daring of that thousand-year\n odyssey. The realization\n left him more alarmed than\n before—for what technical marvels\n might not an isolated group\n of such dogged specialists have\n developed during a millennium\n of application?\n \n Such a weapon as had brought\n down the helihopper and scouter\n was patently beyond reach of his\n own latter-day technology. Perhaps,\n he thought, its possession\n explained the presence of these\n people here in the first stronghold\n of the Hymenops; perhaps\n they had even fought and defeated\n the Bees on their own invaded\n ground.\n \n He followed his white-smocked\n guide through a power room\n where great crude generators\n whirred ponderously, pouring\n out gross electric current into\n arm-thick cables. They were\n nearing the bow of the ship\n when they passed by another\n open port and Farrell, glancing\n out over the lowered rampway,\n saw that his fears for Stryker\n and Gibson had been well\n grounded.\n \n The Marco Four , ports open,\n lay grounded outside.\n \n \n \n Farrell could not have said,\n later, whether his next move\n was planned or reflexive. The\n whole desperate issue seemed to\n hang suspended for a breathless\n moment upon a hair-fine edge of\n decision, and in that instant he\n made his bid.\n \n Without pausing in his stride\n he sprang out and through the\n port and down the steep plane\n of the ramp. The rough stone\n pavement of the square drummed\n underfoot; sore muscles\n tore at him, and weakness was\n like a weight about his neck. He\n expected momentarily to be\n blasted out of existence.\n \n He reached the Marco Four with the startled shouts of his\n guide ringing unintelligibly in\n his ears. The port yawned; he\n plunged inside and stabbed at\n controls without waiting to seat\n himself. The ports swung shut.\n The ship darted up under his\n manipulation and arrowed into\n space with an acceleration that\n sprung his knees and made his\n vision swim blackly.\n \n He was so weak with strain\n and with the success of his coup\n that he all but fainted when\n Stryker, his scanty hair tousled\n and his fat face comical with bewilderment,\n stumbled out of his\n sleeping cubicle and bellowed at\n him.\n \n \"What the hell are you doing,\n Arthur? Take us down!\"\n \n Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n \n Stryker lumbered past him\n and took the controls, spiraling\n the Marco Four down. Men\n swarmed outside the ports when\n the Reclamations craft settled\n gently to the square again. Gibson\n and Xavier reached the ship\n first; Gibson came inside quickly,\n leaving the mechanical outside\n making patient explanations\n to an excited group of Alphardians.\n \n Gibson put a reassuring hand\n on Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\n Arthur. There's no trouble.\"\n \n Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\n understand. They didn't shoot\n you and Xav down too?\"\n \n It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n \n \"No one shot you down! These\n people are primitive enough to\n use metallic power lines to\n carry electricity to their hamlets,\n an anachronism you forgot\n last night. You piloted the helihopper\n into one of those lines,\n and the crash put you out for\n the rest of the night and most\n of today. These Alphardians are\n friendly, so desperately happy to\n be found again that it's really\n pathetic.\"\n \n \" Friendly? That torpedo—\"\n \n \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\n Stryker put in. Understanding\n of the error under which Farrell\n had labored erased his\n earlier irritation, and he chuckled\n commiseratingly. \"They had\n one small boat left for emergency\n missions, and sent it up to\n contact us in the fear that we\n might overlook their settlement\n and move on. The boat was\n atomic powered, and our shield\n screens set off its engines.\"\n \n Farrell dropped into a chair at\n the chart table, limp with reaction.\n He was suddenly exhausted,\n and his head ached dully.\n \n \"We cracked the communications\n problem early last night,\"\n Gibson said. \"These people use\n an ancient system of electromagnetic\n wave propagation called\n frequency modulation, and once\n Lee and I rigged up a suitable\n transceiver the rest was simple.\n Both Xav and I recognized the\n old language; the natives reported\n your accident, and we came\n down at once.\"\n \n \"They really came from Terra?\n They lived through a thousand\n years of flight?\"\n \n \"The ship left Terra for\n Sirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\n aboard, or their ancestors. That\n expedition perished after less\n than a light-year when its\n hydroponics system failed. The\n Hymenops found the ship derelict\n when they invaded us, and\n brought it to Alphard Six in\n what was probably their first experiment\n with human subjects.\n The ship's log shows clearly\n what happened to the original\n complement. The rest is deducible\n from the situation here.\"\n \n Farrell put his hands to his\n temples and groaned. \"The crash\n must have scrambled my wits.\n Gib, where did they come from?\"\n \n \"From one of the first peripheral\n colonies conquered by the\n Bees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\n planners, remember, and masters\n of hypnotic conditioning. They\n stocked the ship with a captive\n crew of Terrans conditioned to\n believe themselves descendants\n of the original crew, and\n grounded it here in disabled\n condition. They left for Alphard\n Five then, to watch developments.\n \n \"Succeeding generations of\n colonists grew up accepting the\n fact that their ship had missed\n Sirius and made planetfall here—they\n still don't know where\n they really are—by luck. They\n never knew about the Hymenops,\n and they've struggled along\n with an inadequate technology in\n the hope that a later expedition\n would find them. They found the\n truth hard to take, but they're\n eager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\n assimilation.\"\n \n Stryker, grinning, brought\n Farrell a frosted drink that tinkled\n invitingly. \"An unusually\n fortunate ending to a Hymenop\n experiment,\" he said. \"These\n people progressed normally because\n they've been let alone. Reorienting\n them will be a simple\n matter; they'll be properly spoiled\n colonists within another generation.\"\n \n Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n \n \"But I don't see why the Bees\n should go to such trouble to deceive\n these people. Why did they\n sit back and let them grow as\n they pleased, Gib? It doesn't\n make sense!\"\n \n \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\n said. \"The Bees set up this\n colony as a control unit to study\n the species they were invading,\n and they had to give their\n specimens a normal—if obsolete—background\n in order to determine\n their capabilities. The fact\n that their experiment didn't tell\n them what they wanted to know\n may have had a direct bearing\n on their decision to pull out.\"\n \n Farrell shook his head. \"It's\n a reverse application, isn't it of\n the old saw about Terrans being\n incapable of understanding an\n alien culture?\"\n \n \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\n surely—hard as they tried, the\n Bees never understood us\n either.\"\n \n \n THE END",

In the past, they were invaded by an alien species called Hymenops, or the Bees, who enslaved Terrans, and tried to colonize other planets but unexpectedly left years later. The crew members of the spaceship Marco Four are on a mission looking for the slave colonies that were abandoned by the Bees. Farrell, the navigator, is arguing with captain Stryker, Gibson - an engineer - and Xavier, the ship’s mechanic, and is trying to convince them to land on Alphard Six and claiming the planet is not inhabited. Stryker reminds him about the importance of vigilance on unexplored territories and tells Farrell to find a reconnaissance spiral. Something resembling an atomic torpedo explodes near the ship, rocking it. Later, the crew starts discussing who can possibly live on Alphard Six. They know that in the year 3000, there was no one on the planet. The ones who attacked them might be the Hymenopes or some Terrans enslaved by them, or even an unknown alien culture. The screen shows a town with a thousand buildings and a prehistoric ship with rocket propulsion. This ship seems to be eleven hundred years old, which is puzzling. This atomic-powered spaceship neither could’ve been constructed here nor could it have successfully traveled for hundreds of years. The area around Alphard Six was guarded by the Bees for several hundred years. So, it would be impossible for this ancient Terran ship to land on the planet without being detected by them. Farrell interrupts the discussion and suggests they go down and look. He gets on a helihopper, and Xavier quickly disappears in his scouter. The two other crew members left on the ship say that they just detected an electromagnetic vibration. Farrell notices a bonfire near the town. He is ready to report it when his helihopper suddenly jerks, a flare of electric discharge blinds him, and Farrell loses consciousness. He wakes up in an infirmary. A doctor speaks in unintelligible words and gestures to Farrell to follow him. While walking through the corridors of the ancient ship, he notices Xavier’s scouter, and later the Marco Four. Shocked, Farrell rapidly plunges inside the spaceship, and it darts up when suddenly Stryker appears from the sleeping cubicle and orders him to fly back. Gibson explains that Farrell piloted his helihopper into power lines and crashed. The Alphardians tried to communicate with the crew using an electromagnetic wave language and never attacked them. The Bees made the ancestors of these people believe that they were the descendants of an Earth expedition that perished a thousand years ago. The Alphardians don’t even know the Hymenops. Apparently, the Bees wanted to monitor the human species in a natural habitat. But they never understood human logic and after all, left all their colonies. "

The crew has gone to the Alphard Six, which has a cool green disk. The other members of the crew are Stryker, Gibson, and Xavier. Stryker berates Farrell and begins citing the Reclamations Handbook about the rules regarding unreclaimed worlds. Farrell argues that it was never colonized, while Gibson looks up from his chess game and says there is no point in taking a chance of not encountering any of the Hymenops. Farrell says that they will never see a Hymenop, but Stryker says that he fought them for the better half of the century and still does not understand how they behave. They decide to find a reconnaissance spiral, despite Farrell grumbling. They examine whether anything is damaged on the Marco Four, after an explosion, and find that the only component that requires fixing is the Zero Transfer computer. Gibson explains that they cannot be Hymenops since the Bees put their faith in Ringwave energy fields. Although Stryker proposes colonists migrating from somewhere else, Gibson explains that it is impossible for the human slaves of the Hymenops to develop interstellar travel in four generations. Farrell volunteers to go down for the field work; Xavier announces that the planet is uninhabited except for a large island. There is a central city with a thousand buildings, and Farrell is relieved they are human. The power the people use runs on continuous fission, which surprises everyone. It is quite surprising for the crew to see an eleven-hundred year old Terran ship land on the planet. Stryker explains to Farrell that it had to be flown here because there are no materials on Alphard Six to create it. Gibson believes that the ship was built during the Twenty-second century, even though the atomic wars destroyed all historical records. Farrell decides that the only way is to go down and see for themselves. Xavier picks up an electromagnetic vibration pattern, and Farrell reports that he is passing over a hamlet nearest to the city. Suddenly, he is hit by an electric discharge and wakes up in an infirmary. A man comes and takes him out, despite speaking a different language, and he realizes that one of the old ventures had actually succeeded. He sees that the Marco Four has been grounded too and runs to the ship before pushing some controls to take off again. Stryker brings the ship down again, and Farrell is shocked because he thought they were shot down. It turns out that the Alphardians had been trying to send a distress signal. Gibson further explains that they had come from one of the first Bee colonies and were led to believe that their ship missed Sirius; however, the colonists are excited to enjoy assimilation. Although the Bees tried to set up the experiment to understand humans, the invaders failed at truly understanding them. "

As they travel around, a sudden atomic fire hits the ship and the crew hurry to figure out where it had come from and who potentially caused it. Debating between Hymenops, resurgent colonists,  trans-Alphardians, or even a joint hallucination, the crew decide to investigate further. Xavier, the mechanical, surveys the planet and finds the landscape to be Terran, though with primitive technology at best. These findings leave them more confused than before, as they then debate how an eleven hundred years old ship could be there. \n\nDeciding then to investigate first-hand and see, Farrell goes into the helihopper and enters the colony. Just as Gibson encourages to go forward as it seems like the colony is communicating with them, Farrell crashes into an electrical line and falls unconscious. As he wakes up, Farrell is met by an unfamiliar medic and follows him out to a well-formed colony, marvelling at the presumed success of old ventures. However, he panics when he sees the Marco Four grounded and presumes his crewmates are in danger, and so he hurriedly rushes onboard and puts it in flight. Stryker stumbles out and takes them back down as Gibson quickly explains to Farrell the situation. It turns out that there is no danger at hand - the crash that landed Farrell unconscious was just an electrical line for the colony's hamlets. The colony, the Alphardians, are friendly and excited to be found. Although using Terran architecture and technology, these Alphardians were experimental human subjects by the Hymenops and observed by the Bees. The Bees chose to abandon their control colony when the Alphardians didn't show much - much like the old tale of Terrans not understanding alien culture either. In the end, the Alphardians are excited to assimilate into Terran colonists. "

When the youngest navigator, Farrell, attempts to planetfall without scouting the planet, the captain, Stryker, reminds him of the possible danger of the planet and the necessity of reconnaissance. After arguing with other crew members, Farrell finally accepts to scout the unobserved world first. However, they are suddenly attacked by a thing rising from the land below. After the examination, Gibson, the engineer, announces that the only damage is Zero Interval Transfer Computer, used to operate the Transfer jump in space. The repairing time takes a couple of hours. Stryker worries about the possible attack during the repairing time, so they dispute the potential situation of the planet, and none of the hypotheses, such as the Hymenops’ colorizations, Earthmen’s ancient colonization, or the resurgent Terran colonization, hold based on technological development. Stryker concludes that they have to investigate the land themselves. Farrell volunteers to be the one. They see the ground through magnoscanner, finding a damaged spaceship that served as a power supply with the prehistoric technology, namely atomic fission. According to Gibson, the atomic-powered ship was no longer built after the atomic wars in the twenty-second century; the damaged ship must either be flown or be built on the planet. His hypothesis is rejected by Stryker and Farrell based on the impossibility of the long-range travel capability of the atomic-powered spaceship. They continue their endless debate until Farrell takes the helihopper to investigate. Xavier, the mechanic, uses his drone to scout ahead of Farrell, but soon the scouter is detected by the people on the planet. They try to communicate with them with the electron beam. When Farrell reaches the end of the forest, entering the fields, he is suddenly struck and passes out. When he wakes up, he is in an infirmary; an anachronistic man comes in. He talks and gestures unintelligibly, but Farrell follows him out, seeing Xavier’s scouter with port open. When Farrell follows the man, he sees Marco Four landed with the port open. Held by the guess that these people may possess higher technology and capture all of them, Farrell rushes into Marco Four, closes the port, and rises. Stryker appears and comes to him with bewilderment, driving the spaceship to land again. It is later explained that Hymenops take these people as the experimental object. The damaged ship was an expedition ship, which failed its duty. Hymenops found its derelict during their invasion and colonization of Terran planets. They put these people on the planet, made them believe that their ancestors were the crewmembers of the damaged ship, and conducted this experiment as a control group, compared to other experiments on other planets."

He tries to convince captain Stryker to land on Alphard Six, claiming that it cannot be inhabited. Stryker doesn’t agree and orders Farrell to find a reconnaissance spiral. After the torpedo explodes near the ship, they all discuss who the attackers could be. Farrell points out that there was no sign of life on Alphard Six around the year 3000, so the inhabitants appeared after this. Farrell agrees to be sent to the planet’s surface and explore. They continue talking and soon see an ancient ship in the center of the planet’s town. Farrell is quick to state that it couldn’t have come from Earth because it would've taken hundreds of years to travel here, and the ship’s ancient technology is not effective enough for such a voyage. Irritated, he interrupts the discussion and suggests he and Xavier go down and see who the inhabitants are. Farrell flies in a helihopper and notices a bonfire near the town. He starts reporting when the helihopper’s carriage crumples, an electric discharge blinds Farrell, and he momentarily loses consciousness. Later, he wakes up with a brutal headache in an infirmary inside the ancient ship. A medic with anachronistic spectacles and gray hair uses unintelligible words and gestures to Farrell to follow him. They pass several open ports, and he sees Xavier’s scouter and later the Marco Four. Shocked, he runs to the spaceship and takes off, when unexpectedly Stryker appears near him, ordering him to take the ship down. Soon Gibson explains that Farrell piloted into metallic power lines, and the crash put him out for almost a day. These Alphardians are incredibly friendly. The object the crew considered a torpedo was actually an emergency boat the inhabitants sent to the spaceship to make sure the people on board noticed their colony. Their spaceship’s technology set off the atomic engines of the boat, making it explode. Gibson and Xavier recognized an old language of frequency modulation the night before, heard about Farrell’s crash, and landed the ship to help. It turns out that the expedition that left Terra for Sirius in 2171 perished soon, and the Bees brought the spacecraft here. They also brought some people from their peripheral colonies conditioned to believe themselves descendants of the expedition. They have been let alone. Farrell understands that the Bees were trying to monitor this group and understand humans’ logic, but they never did. \n\n"

It is where discussions between the crewmates occur as they debate the origins and potential inhabitants of Alphard Six. "

The planet looks uninhabitable except for a large island. Twenty-seven small farmhouses are surrounded by the cultivated fields on the island, surrounded by the forest. There is a city strewn with many buildings, the center of which is a square that rests a damaged spaceship of a size ten times larger than Marco Four. The damaged spaceship is used for the power supply in the city. Streets stretch out from the square in order."

It also partially leads to the invasion of the Bees and allows humans to fight with them. The knowledge about the history of the Ringwave propulsion-communication principle, especially the fact that it was discovered in 2100, also helps the crew realize that the spaceship on planet Alphard Six is atomic-powered and thus prehistoric. It’s eleven hundred years old, also Terran, and was brought here from somewhere else. \n"

                "response_text": "The Ringwave technology is what both the Bees and humans put their faith in. Ringwave energy is said to be very reliable, capable of long-range travel. Compared to any primitive technology before, the Ringwave and its Zero Interval Transfer principle was the only way for any instantaneous communication. It has been around since 2100, completely replacing rocket propulsion because the principles were so much more advanced. Even on the Marco Four, there is a Ringwave board and Ringwave generators used for travel through space. It is significant both for the humans and the Bees because both species rely on it for exploration. When the Bees colonized and conquered the humans, they relied on this technology. During the reclamation crew’s travels, they also used this technology to go to the different planets. "

                "response_text": "The Ringwave technology is significant because it is what propelled Terrans forward in their technological pursuits and is what helps advance their generation. It is what allows them to pursue long-range travel and interstellar flight as the crew go about their reclamation journey. Additionally, this is the point of similarity between the Terrans and the Bees as they both rely on Ringwave energy fields over missiles as the choice weapon. \n\nIt is also significant because it highlights the difference between the Terrans and the Bees described and the Alphardians later discovered in the story. The Terrans and the Bees have access to such advanced technology that not only empowers their knowledge but their way of living, transportation, etc. In contrast, the Alphardians remain in the past with their comparatively archaic technologies and methods."

                "response_text": "Ringwave technology is an energy field used for the energy source of Macro Four, the Terran Reclamation spaceship. Both humans and the alien species, Hymenops or the Bees, possess the Ringwave technology. Before the invention of Ringwave’s propulsion-communication principle in 2100, humans used atomic fission and rocket propulsion. However, only the Zero Interval Transfer principle and the instantaneous communication of Ringwave technology can make long-range interstellar travel possible. Since it was invented, the atomic fission stage in technology has long been abandoned for its destructive power and incapability to sustain long-range space travel. Therefore, when the spaceship is attacked by a seemingly guided missile, which can only be equipped with atomic technology, the crew members deny all the hypotheses of the possible situation of the unobserved planet based on the technological development and the necessary time taken. Ringwave technology is significant in that the crew members theorize or assume the situation on the unobserved planet based on its existence and technological development."
