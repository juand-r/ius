      "content": "Henry Slesar, young New York advertising executive and by now no\n longer a new-comer to either this magazine or to this field, describes\n a strange little town that you, yourself, may blunder into one of these\n evenings. But, if you do, beware—beware of the Knights!\n \n\n\n  dream town\n \n\n by ... HENRY SLESAR\n \n\n\n\n  The woman in the doorway looked so harmless. Who\n was to tell she had some rather startling interests?\n \n \n The\n woman in the\n doorway looked like Mom in\n the homier political cartoons.\n She was plump, apple-cheeked,\n white-haired. She\n wore a fussy, old-fashioned\n nightgown, and was busily\n clutching a worn house-robe\n around her expansive middle.\n She blinked at Sol Becker's\n rain-flattened hair and hang-dog\n expression, and said:\n\"What is it? What do you\n want?\"\n \n \"I'm sorry—\" Sol's voice\n was pained. \"The man in the\n diner said you might put me\n up. I had my car stolen: a\n hitchhiker; going to Salinas ...\"\n He was puffing.\n \n \"Hitchhiker? I don't understand.\"\n She clucked at the\n sight of the pool of water he\n was creating in her foyer.\n\"Well, come inside, for heaven's\n sake. You're soaking!\"\n \n \"Thanks,\" Sol said gratefully.\n \n With the door firmly shut\n behind him, the warm interior\n of the little house covered\n him like a blanket. He\n shivered, and let the warmth\n seep over him. \"I'm terribly\n sorry. I know how late it is.\"\n He looked at his watch, but\n the face was too misty to\n make out the hour.\n \n \"Must be nearly three,\" the\n woman sniffed. \"You couldn't\n have come at a worse time. I\n was just on my way to\n court—\"\n \n The words slid by him. \"If\n I could just stay overnight.\n Until the morning. I could\n call some friends in San Fernando.\n I'm very susceptible to\n head colds,\" he added inanely.\n \n \"Well, take those shoes off,\n first,\" the woman grumbled.\n\"You can undress in the parlor,\n if you'll keep off the rug.\n You won't mind using the\n sofa?\"\n \n \"No, of course not. I'd be\n happy to pay—\"\n \n \"Oh, tush, nobody's asking\n you to pay. This isn't a hotel.\n You mind if I go back upstairs?\n They're gonna miss\n me at the palace.\"\n \n \"No, of course not,\" Sol\n said. He followed her into\n the darkened parlor, and\n watched as she turned the\n screw on a hurricane-style\n lamp, shedding a yellow pool\n of light over half a flowery\n sofa and a doily-covered wing\n chair. \"You go on up. I'll be\n perfectly fine.\"\n \n \"Guess you can use a towel,\n though. I'll get you one,\n then I'm going up. We wake\n pretty early in this house.\n Breakfast's at seven; you'll\n have to be up if you want\n any.\"\n \n \"I really can't thank you\n enough—\"\n \n \"Tush,\" the woman said.\n She scurried out, and returned\n a moment later with a\n thick bath towel. \"Sorry I\n can't give you any bedding.\n But you'll find it nice and\n warm in here.\" She squinted\n at the dim face of a ship's-wheel\n clock on the mantle,\n and made a noise with her\n tongue. \"Three-thirty!\" she\n exclaimed. \"I'll miss the\n whole execution ...\"\n \n \"The what?\"\n \n \"Goodnight, young man,\"\n Mom said firmly.\n \n She padded off, leaving Sol\n holding the towel. He patted\n his face, and then scrubbed\n the wet tangle of brown hair.\n Carefully, he stepped off the\n carpet and onto the stone\n floor in front of the fireplace.\n He removed his\n drenched coat and suit jacket,\n and squeezed water out\n over the ashes.\n \n He stripped down to his\n underwear, wondering about\n next morning's possible embarrassment,\n and decided to\n use the damp bath towel as a\n blanket. The sofa was downy\n and comfortable. He curled\n up under the towel, shivered\n once, and closed his eyes.\n \n \n \n He\n was tired and very\n sleepy, and his customary\n nightly review was limited to\n a few detached thoughts\n about the wedding he was\n supposed to attend in Salinas\n that weekend ... the hoodlum\n who had responded to his\n good-nature by dumping him\n out of his own car ... the slogging\n walk to the village ...\n the little round woman who\n was hurrying off, like the\n White Rabbit, to some mysterious\n appointment on the\n upper floor ...\n \n Then he went to sleep.\n \n A voice awoke him, shrill\n and questioning.\n \n \"Are you nakkid ?\"\n \n His eyes flew open, and he\n pulled the towel protectively\n around his body and glared\n at the little girl with the rust-red\n pigtails.\n \n \"Huh, mister?\" she said,\n pushing a finger against her\n freckled nose. \"Are you?\"\n \n \"No,\" he said angrily. \"I'm\n not naked. Will you please\n go away?\"\n \n \"Sally!\" It was Mom, appearing\n in the doorway of the\n parlor. \"You leave the gentleman\n alone.\" She went off\n again.\n \n \"Yes,\" Sol said. \"Please let\n me get dressed. If you don't\n mind.\" The girl didn't move.\n\"What time is it?\"\n \n \"Dunno,\" Sally shrugged.\n\"I like poached eggs. They're\n my favorite eggs in the whole\n world.\"\n \n \"That's good,\" Sol said desperately.\n\"Now why don't you\n be a good girl and eat your\n poached eggs. In the kitchen.\"\n \n \"Ain't ready yet. You going\n to stay for breakfast?\"\n \n \"I'm not going to do anything\n until you get out of\n here.\"\n \n She put the end of a pigtail\n in her mouth and sat down on\n the chair opposite. \"I went to\n the palace last night. They\n had an exelution.\"\n \n \"Please,\" Sol groaned. \"Be\n a good girl, Sally. If you let\n me get dressed, I'll show you\n how to take your thumb off.\"\n \n \"Oh, that's an old trick. Did\n you ever see an exelution?\"\n \n \"No. Did you ever see a little\n girl with her hide\n tanned?\"\n \n \"Huh?\"\n \n \" Sally! \" Mom again, sterner.\n\"You get out of there, or\n you-know-what ...\"\n \n \"Okay,\" the girl said\n blithely. \"I'm goin' to the palace\n again. If I brush my\n teeth. Aren't you ever gonna\n get up?\" She skipped out of\n the room, and Sol hastily sat\n up and reached for his\n trousers.\n \n When he had dressed, the\n clothes still damp and unpleasant\n against his skin, he\n went out of the parlor and\n found the kitchen. Mom was\n busy at the stove. He said:\n\"Good morning.\"\n \n \"Breakfast in ten minutes,\"\n she said cheerfully. \"You like\n poached eggs?\"\n \n \"Sure. Do you have a telephone?\"\n \n \"In the hallway. Party line,\n so you may have to wait.\"\n \n He tried for fifteen minutes\n to get through, but there\n was a woman on the line who\n was terribly upset about a\n cotton dress she had ordered\n from Sears, and was telling\n the world about it.\n \n Finally, he got his call\n through to Salinas, and a\n sleepy-voiced Fred, his old\n Army buddy, listened somewhat\n indifferently to his tale\n of woe. \"I might miss the\n wedding,\" Sol said unhappily.\n\"I'm awfully sorry.\" Fred\n didn't seem to be half as sorry\n as he was. When Sol hung\n up, he was feeling more despondent\n than ever.\n \n A man, tall and rangy, with\n a bobbing Adam's apple and\n a lined face, came into the\n hallway. \"Hullo?\" he said inquiringly.\n\"You the fella had\n the car stolen?\"\n \n \"Yes.\"\n \n The man scratched his ear.\n\"Take you over to Sheriff\n Coogan after breakfast. He'll\n let the Stateys know about it.\n My name's Dawes.\"\n \n Sol accepted a careful\n handshake.\n \n \"Don't get many people\n comin' into town,\" Dawes\n said, looking at him curiously.\n\"Ain't seen a stranger in\n years. But you look like the\n rest of us.\" He chuckled.\n \n Mom called out: \"Breakfast!\"\n \n \n \n At\n the table, Dawes\n asked his destination.\n \n \"Wedding in Salinas,\" he\n explained. \"Old Army friend\n of mine. I picked this hitchhiker\n up about two miles from\n here. He seemed okay.\"\n \n \"Never can tell,\" Dawes\n said placidly, munching egg.\n\"Hey, Ma. That why you\n were so late comin' to court\n last night?\"\n \n \"That's right, Pa.\" She\n poured the blackest coffee\n Sol had ever seen. \"Didn't\n miss much, though.\"\n \n \"What court is that?\" Sol\n asked politely, his mouth full.\n \n \"Umagum,\" Sally said, a\n piece of toast sticking out\n from the side of her mouth.\n\"Don't you know nothin' ?\"\n \n \" Arma gon,\" Dawes corrected.\n He looked sheepishly at\n the stranger. \"Don't expect\n Mister—\" He cocked an eyebrow.\n\"What's the name?\"\n \n \"Becker.\"\n \n \"Don't expect Mr. Becker\n knows anything about Armagon.\n It's just a dream, you\n know.\" He smiled apologetically.\n \n \"Dream? You mean this—Armagon\n is a place you dream\n about?\"\n \n \"Yep,\" Dawes said. He lifted\n cup to lip. \"Great coffee,\n Ma.\" He leaned back with a\n contented sigh. \"Dream about\n it every night. Got so used to\n the place, I get all confused\n in the daytime.\"\n \n Mom said: \"I get muddle-headed\n too, sometimes.\"\n \n \"You mean—\" Sol put his\n napkin in his lap. \"You mean you dream about the same\n place?\"\n \n \"Sure,\" Sally piped. \"We\n all go there at night. I'm goin'\n to the palace again, too.\"\n \n \"If you brush your teeth,\"\n Mom said primly.\n \n \"If I brush my teeth. Boy,\n you shoulda seen the exelution!\"\n \n \"Execution,\" her father\n said.\n \n \"Oh, my goodness!\" Mom\n got up hastily. \"That reminds\n me. I gotta call poor Mrs.\n Brundage. It's the least I\n could do.\"\n \n \"Good idea,\" Dawes nodded.\n\"And I'll have to round\n up some folks and get old\n Brundage out of there.\"\n \n Sol was staring. He opened\n his mouth, but couldn't think\n of the right question to ask.\n Then he blurted out: \"What\n execution?\"\n \n \"None of your business,\"\n the man said coldly. \"You eat\n up, young man. If you want\n me to get Sheriff Coogan\n lookin' for your car.\"\n \n The rest of the meal went\n silently, except for Sally's insistence\n upon singing her\n school song between mouthfuls.\n When Dawes was\n through, he pushed back his\n plate and ordered Sol to get\n ready.\n \n Sol grabbed his topcoat and\n followed the man out the\n door.\n \n \"Have to stop someplace\n first,\" Dawes said. \"But we'll\n be pickin' up the Sheriff on\n the way. Okay with you?\"\n \n \"Fine,\" Sol said uneasily.\n \n The rain had stopped, but\n the heavy clouds seemed reluctant\n to leave the skies over\n the small town. There was a\n skittish breeze blowing, and\n Sol Becker tightened the collar\n of his coat around his\n neck as he tried to keep up\n with the fast-stepping Dawes.\n \n \n \n They\n crossed the\n street diagonally, and entered\n a two-story wooden building.\n Dawes took the stairs at a\n brisk pace, and pushed open\n the door on the second floor.\n A fat man looked up from\n behind a desk.\n \n \"Hi, Charlie. Thought I'd\n see if you wanted to help\n move Brundage.\"\n \n The man batted his eyes.\n\"Oh, Brundage!\" he said.\n\"You know, I clean forgot\n about him?\" He laughed.\n\"Imagine me forgetting\n that?\"\n \n \"Yeah.\" Dawes wasn't\n amused. \"And you Prince Regent.\"\n \n \"Aw, Willie—\"\n \n \"Well, come on. Stir that\n fat carcass. Gotta pick up\n Sheriff Coogan, too. This\n here gentleman has to see him\n about somethin' else.\"\n \n The man regarded Sol suspiciously.\n\"Never seen you\n before. Night or day. Stranger?\"\n \n \"Come on !\" Dawes said.\n \n The fat man grunted and\n hoisted himself out of the\n swivel chair. He followed\n lamely behind the two men\n as they went out into the\n street again.\n \n A woman, with an empty\n market basket, nodded casually\n to them. \"Mornin', folks.\n Enjoyed it last night.\n Thought you made a right\n nice speech, Mr. Dawes.\"\n \n \"Thanks,\" Dawes answered\n gruffly, but obviously flattered.\n\"We were just goin'\n over to Brundage's to pick up\n the body. Ma's gonna pay a\n call on Mrs. Brundage around\n ten o'clock. You care to visit?\"\n \n \"Why, I think that's very\n nice,\" the woman said. \"I'll\n be sure and do that.\" She\n smiled at the fat man. \"Mornin',\n Prince.\"\n \n Sol's head was spinning. As\n they left the woman and continued\n their determined\n march down the quiet street,\n he tried to find answers.\n \n \"Look, Mr. Dawes.\" He was\n panting; the pace was fast.\n\"Does she dream about this—Armagon,\n too? That woman\n back there?\"\n \n \"Yep.\"\n \n Charlie chuckled. \"He's a\n stranger, all right.\"\n \n \"And you, Mr.—\" Sol\n turned to the fat man. \"You\n also know about this palace\n and everything?\"\n \n \"I told you,\" Dawes said\n testily. \"Charlie here's Prince\n Regent. But don't let the fancy\n title fool you. He got no\n more power than any Knight\n of the Realm. He's just too\n dern fat to do much more'n\n sit on a throne and eat grapes.\n That right, Charlie?\"\n \n The fat man giggled.\n \n \"Here's the Sheriff,\" Dawes\n said.\n \n The Sheriff, a sleepy-eyed\n citizen with a long, sad face,\n was rocking on a porch as\n they approached his house,\n trying to puff a half-lit pipe.\n He lifted one hand wearily\n when he saw them.\n \n \"Hi, Cookie,\" Dawes\n grinned. \"Thought you, me,\n and Charlie would get Brundage's\n body outa the house.\n This here's Mr. Becker; he\n got another problem. Mr.\n Becker, meet Cookie Coogan.\"\n \n The Sheriff joined the procession,\n pausing only once to\n inquire into Sol's predicament.\n \n He described the hitchhiker\n incident, but Coogan\n listened stoically. He murmured\n something about the\n Troopers, and shuffled alongside\n the puffing fat man.\n \n Sol soon realized that their\n destination was a barber shop.\n \n Dawes cupped his hands\n over the plate glass and\n peered inside. Gold letters on\n the glass advertised: HAIRCUT\n SHAVE & MASSAGE\n PARLOR. He reported: \"Nobody\n in the shop. Must be\n upstairs.\"\n \n \n \n The\n fat man rang the\n bell. It was a while before an\n answer came.\n \n It was a reedy woman in a\n housecoat, her hair in curlers,\n her eyes red and swollen.\n \n \"Now, now,\" Dawes said\n gently. \"Don't you take on\n like that, Mrs. Brundage. You\n heard the charges. It hadda\n be this way.\"\n \n \"My poor Vincent,\" she\n sobbed.\n \n \"Better let us up,\" the\n Sheriff said kindly. \"No use\n just lettin' him lay there,\n Mrs. Brundage.\"\n \n \"He didn't mean no harm,\"\n the woman snuffled. \"He was\n just purely ornery, Vincent\n was. Just plain mean stubborn.\"\n \n \"The law's the law,\" the\n fat man sighed.\n \n Sol couldn't hold himself\n in.\n \n \"What law? Who's dead?\n How did it happen?\"\n \n Dawes looked at him disgustedly.\n\"Now is it any of your business? I mean, is it?\"\n \n \"I don't know,\" Sol said\n miserably.\n \n \"You better stay out of\n this,\" the Sheriff warned.\n\"This is a local matter, young\n man. You better stay in the\n shop while we go up.\"\n \n They filed past him and the\n crying Mrs. Brundage.\n \n When they were out of\n sight, Sol pleaded with her.\n \n \"What happened? How did\n your husband die?\"\n \n \"Please ...\"\n \n \"You must tell me! Was it\n something to do with Armagon?\n Do you dream about the\n place, too?\"\n \n She was shocked at the\n question. \"Of course!\"\n \n \"And your husband? Did\n he have the same dream?\"\n \n Fresh tears resulted. \"Can't\n you leave me alone?\" She\n turned her back. \"I got things\n to do. You can make yourself\n comfortable—\" She indicated\n the barber chairs, and left\n through the back door.\n \n Sol looked after her, and\n then ambled over to the first\n chair and slipped into the\n high seat. His reflection in\n the mirror, strangely gray in\n the dim light, made him\n groan. His clothes were a\n mess, and he needed a shave.\n If only Brundage had been\n alive ...\n \n He leaped out of the chair\n as voices sounded behind the\n door. Dawes was kicking it\n open with his foot, his arms\n laden with two rather large\n feet, still encased in bedroom\n slippers. Charlie was at the\n other end of the burden,\n which appeared to be a middle-aged\n man in pajamas. The\n Sheriff followed the trio up\n with a sad, undertaker expression.\n Behind him came Mrs.\n Brundage, properly weeping.\n \n \"We'll take him to the funeral\n parlor,\" Dawes said,\n breathing hard. \"Weighs a\n ton, don't he?\"\n \n \"What killed him?\" Sol\n said.\n \n \"Heart attack.\"\n \n The fat man chuckled.\n \n The tableau was grisly. Sol\n looked away, towards the\n comfortingly mundane atmosphere\n of the barber shop. But\n even the sight of the thick-padded\n chairs, the shaving\n mugs on the wall, the neat\n rows of cutting instruments,\n seemed grotesque and morbid.\n \n \"Listen,\" Sol said, as they\n went through the doorway.\n\"About my car—\"\n \n The Sheriff turned and regarded\n him lugubriously.\n\"Your car ? Young man, ain't\n you got no respect ?\"\n \n Sol swallowed hard and fell\n silent. He went outside with\n them, the woman slamming\n the barber-shop door behind\n him. He waited in front of\n the building while the men\n toted away the corpse to some\n new destination.\n \n \n \n He\n took a walk.\n \n The town was just coming\n to life. People were strolling\n out of their houses, commenting\n on the weather, chuckling\n amiably about local affairs.\n Kids on bicycles were beginning\n to appear, jangling the\n little bells and hooting to\n each other. A woman, hanging\n wash in the back yard,\n called out to him, thinking\n he was somebody else.\n \n He found a little park, no\n more than twenty yards in\n circumference, centered\n around a weatherbeaten monument\n of some unrecognizable\n military figure. Three\n old men took their places on\n the bench that circled the\n General, and leaned on their\n canes.\n \n Sol was a civil engineer.\n But he made like a reporter.\n \n \"Pardon me, sir.\" The old\n man, leathery-faced, with a\n fine yellow moustache, looked\n at him dumbly. \"Have you\n ever heard of Armagon?\"\n \n \"You a stranger?\"\n \n \"Yes.\"\n \n \"Thought so.\"\n \n Sol repeated the question.\n \n \"Course I did. Been goin'\n there ever since I was a kid.\n Night-times, that is.\"\n \n \"How—I mean, what kind\n of place is it?\"\n \n \"Said you're a stranger?\"\n \n \"Yes.\"\n \n \"Then 'tain't your business.\"\n \n That was that.\n \n He left the park, and wandered\n into a thriving luncheonette.\n He tried questioning\n the man behind the counter,\n who merely snickered and\n said: \"You stayin' with the\n Dawes, ain't you? Better ask\n Willie, then. He knows the\n place better than anybody.\"\n \n He asked about the execution,\n and the man stiffened.\n \n \"Don't think I can talk\n about that. Fella broke one of\n the Laws; that's about it.\n Don't see where you come\n into it.\"\n \n At eleven o'clock, he returned\n to the Dawes residence,\n and found Mom in the\n kitchen, surrounded by the\n warm nostalgic odor of home-baked\n bread. She told him\n that her husband had left a\n message for the stranger, informing\n him that the State\n Police would be around to get\n his story.\n \n He waited in the house,\n gloomily turning the pages of\n the local newspaper, searching\n for references to Armagon.\n He found nothing.\n \n At eleven-thirty, a brown-faced\n State Trooper came to\n call, and Sol told his story.\n He was promised nothing,\n and told to stay in town until\n he was contacted again by\n the authorities.\n \n Mom fixed him a light\n lunch, the greatest feature of\n which was some hot biscuits\n she plucked out of the oven.\n It made him feel almost normal.\n \n He wandered around the\n town some more after lunch,\n trying to spark conversation\n with the residents.\n \n He learned little.\n \n \n \n At\n five-thirty, he returned\n to the Dawes house, and was\n promptly leaped upon by\n little Sally.\n \n \"Hi! Hi! Hi!\" she said,\n clutching his right leg and\n almost toppling him over.\n\"We had a party in school. I\n had chocolate cake. You goin'\n to stay with us?\"\n \n \"Just another night,\" Sol\n told her, trying to shake the\n girl off. \"If it's okay with\n your folks. They haven't\n found my car yet.\"\n \n \"Sally!\" Mom was peering\n out of the screen door. \"You\n let Mr. Becker alone and go\n wash. Your Pa will be home\n soon.\"\n \n \"Oh, pooh,\" the girl said,\n her pigtails swinging. \"Do\n you got a girlfriend, mister?\"\n \n \"No.\" Sol struggled towards\n the house with her\n dead weight on his leg.\n\"Would you mind? I can't\n walk.\"\n \n \"Would you be my boyfriend?\"\n \n \"Well, we'll talk about it.\n If you let go my leg.\"\n \n Inside the house, she said:\n\"We're having pot roast. You\n stayin'?\"\n \n \"Of course Mr. Becker's\n stayin',\" Mom said. \"He's our\n guest.\"\n \n \"That's very kind of you,\"\n Sol said. \"I really wish you'd\n let me pay something—\"\n \n \"Don't want to hear another\n word about pay.\"\n \n \n \n Mr. Dawes\n came home an\n hour later, looking tired.\n Mom pecked him lightly on\n the forehead. He glanced at\n the evening paper, and then\n spoke to Sol.\n \n \"Hear you been asking\n questions, Mr. Becker.\"\n \n Sol nodded, embarrassed.\n\"Guess I have. I'm awfully\n curious about this Armagon\n place. Never heard of anything\n like it before.\"\n \n Dawes grunted. \"You ain't\n a reporter?\"\n \n \"Oh, no. I'm an engineer. I\n was just satisfying my own\n curiosity.\"\n \n \"Uh-huh.\" Dawes looked\n reflective. \"You wouldn't be\n thinkin' about writing us up\n or anything. I mean, this is a\n pretty private affair.\"\n \n \"Writing it up?\" Sol\n blinked. \"I hadn't thought of\n it. But you'll have to admit—it's\n sure interesting.\"\n \n \"Yeah,\" Dawes said narrowly.\n\"I guess it would be.\"\n \n \"Supper!\" Mom called.\n \n After the meal, they spent\n a quiet evening at home. Sally\n went to bed, screaming her\n reluctance, at eight-thirty.\n Mom, dozing in the big chair\n near the fireplace, padded upstairs\n at nine. Then Dawes\n yawned widely, stood up, and\n said goodnight at quarter-of-ten.\n \n He paused in the doorway\n before leaving.\n \n \"I'd think about that,\" he\n said. \"Writing it up, I mean.\n A lot of folks would think\n you were just plum crazy.\"\n \n Sol laughed feebly. \"I\n guess they would at that.\"\n \n \"Goodnight,\" Dawes said.\n \n \"Goodnight.\"\n \n He read Sally's copy of Treasure Island for about\n half an hour. Then he undressed,\n made himself comfortable\n on the sofa, snuggled\n under the soft blanket\n that Mom had provided, and\n shut his eyes.\n \n He reviewed the events of\n the day before dropping off\n to sleep. The troublesome\n Sally. The strange dream\n world of Armagon. The visit\n to the barber shop. The removal\n of Brundage's body.\n The conversations with the\n townspeople. Dawes' suspicious\n attitude ...\n \n Then sleep came.\n \n \n \n He\n was flanked by marble\n pillars, thrusting towards\n a high-domed ceiling.\n \n The room stretched long\n and wide before him, the\n walls bedecked in stunning\n purple draperies.\n \n He whirled at the sound of\n footsteps, echoing stridently\n on the stone floor. Someone\n was running towards him.\n \n It was Sally, pigtails\n streaming out behind her, the\n small body wearing a flowing\n white toga. She was shrieking,\n laughing as she skittered\n past him, clutching a gleaming\n gold helmet.\n \n He called out to her, but\n she was too busy outdistancing\n her pursuer. It was Sheriff\n Coogan, puffing and huffing,\n the metal-and-gold cloth\n uniform ludicrous on his\n lanky frame.\n \n \"Consarn kid!\" he wheezed.\n\"Gimme my hat!\"\n \n Mom was following him,\n her stout body regal in scarlet\n robes. \"Sally! You give\n Sir Coogan his helmet! You\n hear?\"\n \n \"Mrs. Dawes!\" Sol said.\n \n \"Why, Mr. Becker! How\n nice to see you again! Pa! Pa! Look who's here!\"\n \n Willie Dawes appeared. No! Sol thought. This was King Dawes; nothing else\n could explain the magnificence\n of his attire.\n \n \"Yes,\" Dawes said craftily.\n\"So I see. Welcome to Armagon,\n Mr. Becker.\"\n \n \"Armagon?\" Sol gaped.\n\"Then this is the place\n you've been dreaming about?\"\n \n \"Yep,\" the King said. \"And\n now you're in it, too.\"\n \n \"Then I'm only dreaming!\"\n \n Charlie, the fat man,\n clumsy as ever in his robes of\n State, said: \"So that's the\n snooper, eh?\"\n \n \"Yep,\" Dawes chuckled.\n\"Think you better round up\n the Knights.\"\n \n Sol said: \"The Knights?\"\n \n \"Exelution! Exelution!\"\n Sally shrieked.\n \n \"Now wait a minute—\"\n \n Charlie shouted.\n \n Running feet, clanking of\n armor. Sol backed up against\n a pillar. \"Now look here.\n You've gone far enough—\"\n \n \"Not quite,\" said the King.\n \n The Knights stepped forward.\n \n \"Wait!\" Sol screamed.\n \n Familiar faces, under shining\n helmets, moved towards\n him; the tips of sharp-pointed\n spears gleaming wickedly.\n And Sol Becker wondered—would\n he ever awake?",

He ends up staying in the house of a young family who are kind enough to host him. They are very nice with him, and even offer him breakfast the next morning. As Sol learns more of the town and the family, he learns that the people in the town share the same dream every night, in a place called the Armagon. He also learns that there was an execution last night in the same place. He follows Willie Dawes, the head of the family, to pick up the body of the person that was executed. They are also accompanied by the sheriff of the town and by a man named Charlie. When Sol sees the body of the executed person, he starts to get worried and starts asking people in the town questions about the Armagon. That night, Sol stays with the Dawes family again, and when he goes to sleep he meets with the townspeople in the Armagon, where it seems that he will be executed. \n\n"

She is confused by why Sol is at her door, and he explains that he is a hitchhiker going to Salinas. She lets him come into her house, where he asks if he can stay the night. She explains that he does not have to pay and rushes back upstairs so she will not miss the execution. Sol goes to sleep and is woken up again by a little girl named Sally. He asks what time it is, but Sally responds that she likes poached eggs. Sol desperately tries to get her to leave, but Mom sends her away. Sol tries to call Fred but is met with indifference; a man named Willie Dawes offers to take him to the sheriff as Mom finishes breakfast. They talk about Armagon during breakfast, which is a place that everybody dreams about at night. Sol asks about the execution again, but Dawes tells him to eat his breakfast. They enter a wooden building to meet Charlie, and Dawes mentions that they are picking up Sheriff Coogan too. As they discuss with the other people, Sol realizes that everybody dreams about Armagon. Charlie is the Prince Regent, and they meet the sheriff too. The men go to the shop to find Mrs. Brundage, who is in grief because of her husband. Sol tries to ask what had happened in Armagon, but Mrs. Brundage refuses to tell him. Everybody is more worried about Mr. Brundage, so Sol goes on a walk and tries to ask about Armagon. Everybody says that it is none of his business, so he has no choice but to stay in the town until his car is found. Sally comes home at five thirty and asks if he is going to stay, and Mom refuses to hear anything about pay. Sol tries to ask Mr. Dawes for some more information again, but he refuses to say anything. When Sol goes to sleep that night, he finds himself awake in Armagon. Sally, Mom, and Mr. Dawes have returned wearing much finer clothing, indicating a higher status. Charlie asks if this is the snooper, and Dawes tells him that he should round up the knights. Sally screams for execution, and the knights begin to appear. They point the tips of their sharp spears at him as Sol wonders if he will ever awake."

Late at night, he picked up a hitchhiker who minutes later pushed Sol out of the car and drove away, leaving the man soaking near an unknown village. He knocked at the door of a village house, and a woman - he called her Mom - let him in. Sol briefly told her what had happened, and she allowed him to sleep on the couch. Anxiously whispering that she would miss some execution, Mom went upstairs, leaving Sol confused but grateful. He got woken up by a little girl named Sally, pestering him with awkward questions - Mom told her to stop and get ready for breakfast. Minutes later, he found a telephone and called Fred, who didn’t seem very upset by the news of Sol probably missing the wedding. After hanging up the phone, Sol talked to a man called Dawes, who promised to take him to Sheriff Coogan to report the car theft after breakfast. Mom called out that the breakfast was ready. Sally told Sol about Armagon - a place both parents and the daughter dreamt about every night. She also started talking about some execution, but Dawes coldly refused to answer Sol’s questions about this. Before meeting the sheriff, Sol and Dawes crossed the street and picked up a man named Charlie or, as Dawes said, Prince Regent. As they were marching down the street, they met a woman who, Sol eventually realized, was also dreaming about Armagon. They finally came to the sheriff’s house. He listened to Sol’s story while they all were walking to a barbershop to pick up the body of a man called Brundage. They saw a crying woman - the wife of the dead, and Sol again made an attempt to understand who got killed and why. Soon, they came back with the body and told Sol to wait while they were carrying it somewhere else. Sol took a walk and again tried to ask citizens about the mystery place from their dreams but didn’t get much information. He then went back to the Dawes residence. A State Trooper asked him some questions about the car and told him to remain in town until further notice. Sol ate lunch, walked for a bit, and returned in the evening. Sally - the daughter - clutched his leg and then started telling him about her day. Mr.Dawes came later and asked Sol about his questions to the citizens and then wondered if the man was a reporter. After a quiet evening, they all went to bed. Sol fell asleep and suddenly realized he was somewhere else, surrounded by marble pillars. He saw Sally running around in a white toga, then the sheriff chasing her. He finally saw Dawes dressed as a king who welcomed Becker to Armagon. The king unexpectedly asked Charlie to round up the knights, and Sally started triumphantly screaming: “Execution!”. Sol asked them to stop, but the knights kept approaching. "

He is also very caring towards his family as well, always eating with Mom and Sally at home. He is very quick to correct Sally’s mistakes as well, when she mispronounces Armagon and execution. However, although Dawes seems friendly, he can turn cold when provoked. Whenever Sol asks about Armagon, Dawes responds coldly and changes the subject. He is also cautious around Sol too, believing that the other man is a reporter who is here to expose the secret of the town. However, Dawes later shows an authoritative side too, donning magnificent attire and living up to his title as a King. "

He seems relatively friendly and approachable when he first meets Sol and promises to take him over to the sheriff. Dawes is rather outgoing - a lot of citizens know him. Still, he is very protective of their town’s dream of Armagon. So whenever Sol asks about this place or the execution, Dawes becomes cold, stern, and uneasy. He plainly refuses to answer the first questions about it and then later makes sure Sol is not a prying journalist who wants to write about Armagon. Dawes also seems rational and emotionless when it comes to Armagon’s laws and those who breach them. For example, he pragmatically approaches the death of Vincent Brundage, who got executed for breaking a rule, and considers his punishment necessary.  "

The townspeople also dream of the town every night, and it is considered to be a town secret that should not be easily told to anybody else.
